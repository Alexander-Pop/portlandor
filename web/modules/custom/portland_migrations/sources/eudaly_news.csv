News,646065,Multnomah County Circuit Court rejects challenge to Relocation Assistance Ordinance,1,,2018-09-19 19:01:13 UTC,2017-07-07 23:32:00 UTC,A,,"<p>The relocation law&nbsp;passed by City Council in February&nbsp;requires landlords to pay between $2,900 to $4,500 in relocation fees to tenants when they've a) raised rents by 10 percent or more, or b) issued a no-cause eviction notice. The law was challenged, and it was announced today that the court agreed with the City on every point and held that the ordinance (1) is not preempted, and (2) does not unconstitutionally impair the obligations of contracts.</p>
<p>""This moment is very important for the City of Portland. At a time when we can&rsquo;t get the support we need from our own state legislature, relocation assistance gives us a measure of hope that we can stand up and defend vulnerable tenants on a local level. With this victory, our next steps will be to focus our efforts on gathering data and refining this law so that it becomes an innovative model for securing tenant protections in Oregon and across the country.""&nbsp;-Commissioner Chloe Eudaly</p>

News,711195,2018 Year In Review,1,,2019-01-31 21:30:43 UTC,2019-01-31 21:19:00 UTC,A,"Policy Accomplishments, Bureau Assignments, & More.","<p>Dear Portland,</p>
<p>While we are already digging into the work ahead of us in the new year, it's important to pause and reflect on what we've achieved together. I'm proud of the work my team and I have done in collaboration with colleagues, bureaus, and the community. Here are some of the highlights of 2018 involving my past and present bureaus, the arts, housing and other initiatives my office has participated in:</p>
<p><strong>ELECTIONS</strong>: First, big props to you -- the residents and voters of Portland -- for electing Jo Ann Hardesty to Portland City Council and passing the Portland Clean Energy Fund and the Metro Housing Bond! I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of all three, and I'm so excited to see what we can do moving forward together with new leadership and resources!</p>
<p>Along with the Office of Community &amp; Civic Life, my office spearheaded the City's first Get Out The Vote effort campaign. This non-partisan, content-neutral GOTV effort focused on four out of five of the lowest voter turnout precincts in the last three elections, which were all located in East Portland. Election results show a notable increase in voter turnout in the four precincts we covered. Voting is one of our most fundamental constitutional rights and is essential to a truly representative democracy. Those who vote are better represented and served. We are ahead of the curve with Oregon's Motor Voter Act and Vote-By-Mail, but it's essential that we continue to decrease barriers to participating in our democratic process, from postage-paid ballots to supports for non-native English speaking voters to continued outreach to underrepresented communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OFFICE OF COMMUNITY &amp; CIVIC LIFE (CIVIC LIFE)</strong>: The Office of Neighborhood Involvement (ONI) turned over a new leaf to become the Office of Community and Civic Life with a renewed commitment to engagement and service to our whole city. Formed initially as a bureau that exclusively served the City's Neighborhood Associations, ONI grew to include service to youth, elders, culturally specific organizations, and people with disabilities. We recognize that communities are not just geographically based, especially in a time of displacement and unaffordability, and that the bureau had to re-envision a more inclusive future. The transformation continues as a devoted committee made up of diverse community members considers changes to our code to create an even wider and more welcoming gateway to civic engagement for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>CANNABIS</strong>: Portland's Cannabis Program is run through the Office of Community &amp; Civic Life. My priorities for the program include supporting local small business and advancing restorative justice efforts that address the disproportionate impact of prohibition on communities of color, in particular, Portland's African American community. In September 2018, I was pleased to introduce and pass social equity policies, which allow us to offer reduced licensing fees for small businesses (with additional reductions for those who utilize women and minority-owned contractors), owners who have marijuana-related convictions, and businesses who employ those with prior convictions. Additionally, we continued our efforts to streamline the process and were able to demonstrate our fiscal responsibility by reducing fees for all license types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUREAU OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (BDS)</strong>: BDS made many significant strides under my leadership before the Mayor reassigned the bureau to himself last fall. I'm pleased to report that BDS issued its first ever online permit last summer and that the bureau is moving ahead on implementing an update to the permitting system that will enable all permits to be reviewed and issued online. At my direction, BDS hired a small business liaison to help small businesses and nonprofits navigate our permitting system. Last February, the City Council adopted new regulations developed by BDS staff that will protect people, particularly children, from lead dust and asbestos during demolitions. A special shout out to Representative Alissa Keny-Guyer and Senator Michael Dembrow who sponsored state legislation that made our local regulations possible.</p>
<p><strong>PORTLAND BUREAU OF TRANSPORTATION (PBOT)</strong>: When Mayor Wheeler assigned PBOT to me last September, my Chief of Staff, Policy Director and I promptly signed up for a Portland Traffic + Transportation Course at Portland State. Congressman Blumenauer launched the course 29 years ago when he was Portland&rsquo;s Transportation Commissioner. It was an invaluable experience: we gained a better understanding of transportation issues past and present and connected with transportation and neighborhood activists from around the city. The class played an important role in helping me pass a visionary plan, Central City in Motion, to make downtown Portland easier and safer to navigate for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. Other highlights of the first couple of months as PBOT Commissioner include: eliminating the difficult to administer leaf pickup fee, participating in a forum about transportation issues with Speaker Kotek and other leaders in North Portland, and getting to know the incredibly talented and dedicated staff at PBOT.</p>
<p><strong>ARTS &amp; CULTURE</strong>: My office already had a strong focus on celebrating and showcasing our arts and culture community, but I was thrilled to be named the new Arts Commissioner last September. We participated in the development of an arts affordability plan spearheaded by Commissioner Fish's office, as well as the hiring process for the new Executive Director of Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council (RACC) and the City of Portland Arts Manager. Thanks to my arts liaison, Pollyanne Faith Birge, we also exhibited and presented over 100 artists and organizations, and produced 18 events that brought over 2500 people to City Hall.</p>
<p><strong>HOUSING</strong>: We were happy to support the creation of the SW Corridor Equitable Housing Strategy in acknowledgment of transits role in gentrification and displacement and lays out an anti-displacement strategy far in advance of the SW Corridor Lightrail Project. We also formalized an agreement with TriMet to give the City of Portland the opportunity to purchase land used for the construction of the Lightrail Project using housing bond dollars to build at least 700 new units of affordable housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our historic Relocation Ordinance was made permanent in 2018. Relo has helped slow down rent increases, keep people in their existing housing, and helps renters who are being involuntarily displaced through no fault of their own to afford to move. It has also had an unanticipated side benefit; we've seen an uptick in inspection requests by renters living in substandard, unsafe units now they have protection against retaliation through no cause evictions or exorbitant rent increases. Portland renters are safer and more stable, but we still have a housing crisis due to rents being out of step with average incomes, and a gross mismatch between the type of housing being built and actual need.</p>
<p><strong>COMBATING HATE AND PROTECTING IMMIGRANT&rsquo;S RIGHTS</strong>: 2018 marked the continuation of increasingly aggressive attacks on immigrant rights. Fortunately, Portlanders continuously organized and showed up to resist these attacks and to support immigrant and refugee communities. I was proud to stand with advocates to defeat the attempted repeal of our sanctuary state policy, to call for the abolition of ICE and to advocate for continued funding for Portland United Against Hate (PUAH) as they develop a community-based approach to tracking and responding to hate incidents. Another highlight was supporting the Urban League's commemoration of the life of Mulugeta Seraw, including the installation of commemorative street sign toppers in the Kerns neighborhood. Finally, I was honored to receive CAUSA&rsquo;s American Dreamer Award for championing the effort to secure $500k for the legal defense of Portlanders facing deportation. This would not have been possible without the incredible coalition of immigration legal service providers and community advocates, who give me hope in challenging times.</p>
<p>Next month we'll take a look forward at 2019, starting with the historic moment we just celebrated by seating Portland's first African American woman Commissioner and Portland's first woman majority City Council.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,</p>

Commissioner's Blog,629952,Opening Statement at Tenant Relocation Ordinance Hearing,2,,2017-02-24 18:21:25 UTC,2017-02-24 17:58:00 UTC,A,"Commissioner Eudaly's Opening Statement at City Council PM Meeting | February 2, 2017","<p>Opening Statement: Commissioner Chloe Eudaly<br />City Council Meeting PM<br />February 2, 2017</p>
<p>I have been living and breathing affordable housing and tenants&rsquo; rights issues for the past two years. It&rsquo;s what inspired me to run for City Council and is in no small part why I was elected, because the fact is that the majority of Portlanders support rent stabilization and increasing tenant protections.</p>
<p>Some people have asked me, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rush on this ordinance?&rdquo; The fact is members of my team were working on relocation for months before we took office and this housing crisis has been growing for the past decade. So we have to ask: what&rsquo;s taking so long?</p>
<p>Emotions are high on both sides of this debate. For the past 30 years, landlords have been allowed to involuntarily displace tenants through no-cause and de facto economic evictions. And now we&rsquo;re asking them to share in the burden that has been wrought on our residents, our communities, our city and our entire region. The fact is we&rsquo;re all paying for this crisis, whether it&rsquo;s through the public dollars we spend on affordable housing, rental assistance and homelessness, or the various ways this crisis is harming our neighborhoods, communities, schools, small businesses, local economy and the overall quality of life for all of our residents.</p>
<p>As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich recently said, &ldquo;Governing by anecdote is not governing. It&rsquo;s demagoguery.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s been disappointing and frustrating to witness opponents to tenant protections <span style=""line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">&ndash;</span> whether community members, lobbyists or legislators <span style=""line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">&ndash;</span>&nbsp;resort to playing on the public&rsquo;s emotions and prejudices rather than basing their positions on facts. But I&rsquo;m going to share a personal anecdote with you today anyway.</p>
<p>My parents became landlords in 1979, when they bought their second home and moved our family from Gales Creek to Sherwood. Early on, they made a misjudgment in tenants and ended up having to evict them for non-payment of rent and other serious infractions. The tenants responded by breaking every window in the house, filling it with garbage and using it as a dog kennel for an untold number of days, so you can imagine what that looked like. My father was driving home from assessing and photographing the damage on a rainy day in October 1983. He lost control of his vehicle on a tight curve, hit an oncoming truck and died instantly. So, if you&rsquo;ve come here today to conjure up the bad tenant bogeyman, the one that precludes us from protecting any tenants, lest we somehow benefit him, please save your breath. I have already met him. And I recognize him for what he is: an anomaly among an ocean of good tenants who follow the rules, who desperately need their deposits back, who are highly dependent on their landlords&rsquo; good reference, in one of the most competitive rental markets this city has ever seen.</p>
<p>If you have a bad tenant, you have clear legal recourse and the law is weighted in the landlords&rsquo; favor. We don&rsquo;t call our eviction court an &ldquo;eviction mill&rdquo; for nothing. If you&rsquo;ve come here today to argue exemptions for mom-and-pop landlords who may experience some level of financial hardship, if required to pay relocation assistance, let me remind you: landlords have been placing that very same hardship on tenants who are generally lower income and have less financial resources than property owners. This is a temporary emergency ordinance intended to stabilize or assist renters at risk of involuntary displacement during our housing crisis. We hope that it will be short-lived, but that will require the state legislature to overturn the ban on rent control and give the city back its regulatory tools.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is an easy way to avoid relocation assistance: do not no-cause evict your tenants and don&rsquo;t raise their rent 10 percent or more per year.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve come here today to tell us, &ldquo;We must simply build our way out of this crisis,&rdquo; I can confidently tell you, as the Commissioner in charge of the Bureau of Development Services and someone with a newfound inside view of our Housing Bureau, it will take decades to build our way out. And that&rsquo;s only if developers are willing to start building for existing demand, which is not the market rate in luxury housing that they are primarily delivering.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve come here today to suggest that renters just move or get better jobs, it shows an utter lack of understanding around who is taking the brunt of the impact created by our housing crisis. Seniors and people with disabilities living on fixed incomes don&rsquo;t have the resources to move or the ability to get better jobs. People of color who have faced historic and ongoing discrimination in both the housing and job markets also tend to have more limited resources and options. Telling someone with limited resources to leave behind their family, their friends and their community, in search of elusive affordable housing elsewhere, is terrible advice.</p>
<p>Finally, this is not a &ldquo;landlord versus tenant&rdquo; conversation. We are not seeking to demonize or penalize landlords, but we are asking them to recognize their role in our housing crisis and share in the burden they&rsquo;re creating, not just for their renters but our entire city, when they choose to involuntarily displace a renter through no fault of the renter. We&rsquo;ve heard from many landlords who support this ordinance, some of whom will be testifying today, who know that they can profitably operate their business, whether they choose to avoid triggering relocation or not. We don&rsquo;t blame landlords for not recognizing how the forces of urban renewal, gentrification, displacement and limited tenant protections converged to create this crisis over the past 30 years, but there&rsquo;s no denying the outcome. Half our residents are renters. Half of renters are cost-burdened by rent. And half of those renters, approximately 75,000 people, live in households that are spending over 50 percent of their income on housing. These households are being forced to choose between paying rent and paying the heating bill, paying rent and paying for vital medical care, paying rent and paying the grocery bill. This is unsustainable, it&rsquo;s unacceptable, and none of the good people of Portland &ndash; renters, homeowners or landlords &ndash; should be willing to sit idly by and let this crisis continue unchecked.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/eudaly/article/629952
Commissioner's Blog,671804,Happy One Year Anniversary of Relo!,2,,2018-02-03 00:12:06 UTC,2018-02-02 23:32:00 UTC,A,,"<p>One year ago today my office introduced an ordinance that established mandatory relocation assistance for tenants facing no-cause evictions or rent increases&nbsp;<img class=""content-right"" style=""border: 0; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 5px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=671810"" alt=""celebrating relo 1 year anniversary"" width=""250"" height=""225"" />of 10% or higher, co-sponsored by the Mayor, and passed unanimously by Council. This ordinance requires landlords to share in the burden they are creating on tenants and our city during our unprecedented housing crisis. It was the strongest protection we could deliver to tenants given how the state legislature has hampered our ability to manage our rent crisis, namely due to the 33-year-old ban on rent control and the preemption on just cause evictions. Next month we will be introducing several amendments recommended by the Relo Technical Advisory Committee -- which is made up of industry, housing, and tenant advocates -- and making relo permanent!</p>
<p>Fighting state interference with local power is a high priority for me. We need the state to set minimum standards for us on issues like protecting our environment and educating our children. We do not need them to make preemptions that favor corporate and special interests and interfere with our ability to best serve our city. We also need their help to solve our housing and homelessness crisis. Several bills are coming before the legislature in the short session which address different challenges we face with homelessness and in creating stable and affordable housing. Unfortunately, tenant protections are not among them, due to how challenging these issues have proven to be most tenant advocates agree they can't be tackled in 35 days.</p>
<p>In October 2015, Portland City Council declared a State of Emergency on Housing and Homelessness at the urging of numerous housing justice advocates, activists, and organizations. I was among them. We had hoped that this declaration would bring meaningful relief to Portland's cost-burdened and displaced renters, as well as people experiencing homelessness. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough, and our housing crisis continues to outpace all of our efforts to address it and finding suitable properties for alternative shelters remains a challenge due to a variety of factors.</p>
<p>It's time for a reality check: we are in the eighth year of a housing crisis in the Metro region. Although developers have added thousands of new units to our rental inventory, they are mostly out of reach of the average income household. Although rent increases may be slowing at the top of the market, we have not seen a decrease in the number of cost-burdened households. We have not seen a significant slow down in the rate of displacement of low and moderate income renters. And we continue to see an inflow of recently housed residents -- including families, seniors, and people with disabilities -- entering our homeless population.</p>
<p>We know that municipalities across the Metro region and the state -- urban, suburban, and rural -- are facing crises of their own. I believe it's time for the Oregon legislature to consider declaring a state of emergency for housing and homelessness which would allow for more power and flexibility for municipalities across the state to address the unique needs and challenges they face. We can't fix this complex problem with a nearly empty toolbox.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/eudaly/article/671804
Commissioner's Blog,671819,In This New Year,2,,2018-02-02 23:59:21 UTC,2018-01-02 23:52:00 UTC,A,,"<p>Dear Portland,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />It's hard to believe it's been a year since I took my seat on City Council! While our memories of 2017 may be overshadowed by the chaos of national politics and local tragedies, I hope that we will also remember the ways in which Portlanders fought back to defend our values and stand up for one another. I am particularly proud of the time and energy my office has devoted to tenants&rsquo; rights, prioritizing people over profit, protecting our immigrant and refugee neighbors, and becoming better stewards of the environment. <br /><br />I also appreciate the hard work and accomplishments of our bureau staff in 2017. I'm looking forward to working closely with our newly appointed Bureau Directors -- Rebecca Esau, of the Bureau of Development Services (BDS), and Suk Rhee, of the Office of Neighborhood Involvement (ONI) -- as we continue our reorganization efforts and improving service to our community members and customers. Some bureau highlights include the swearing in of the New Portlanders Policy Commission and the Information and Referral team stepping up to assist with the response to the Eagle Creek Fire at ONI, and the record-breaking number of permits processed by the Development Services Center at BDS. <br /><br />As my team and I set our policy goals for 2018, we will also be sure to plan more events to celebrate our city and one another. Last year we honored our small business and arts &amp; culture communities by coordinating or hosting events like Dead Moon Night, Boss Ladies PDX, and the PCC Social Practice Art Show. Other highlights include being the emcee at the Spirit of Portland Awards, where I personally honored Kathleen Saadat and The Raging Grannies, and co-chairing the Regional Arts and Culture Council&rsquo;s Battle of the Bands. I'm pleased to report that through many of these events, we welcomed hundreds of Portlanders to City Hall for the first time.<br /><br />In 2017, my team and I learned the lay of the land and adjusted to the routine and demands of City Hall. At times, this meant moderating our ambitions in recognition of the fact that being both an administrator and legislator leaves limited time for discretionary projects. While I am pleased with all that we have accomplished, I also know that we can do better at communicating our efforts to the community, which is something we'll be prioritizing as we move forward. <br /><br />In this new year, I am looking forward to continuing to fight to make Portland a city that works for all of us. Some of my priorities include: strengthening tenant protections via security deposit reform and creating opportunities for homeownership, supporting ADU development, and bringing back the small business liaison and the &ldquo;Get Legal&rdquo; program to assist low-income homeowners at BDS. Through ONI, we hope to demonstrate a new way of conducting civic engagement, and the Cannabis Program will work to proactively and equitably support a growing local industry.<br /><br />This past year has demanded more of all of us&mdash;more courage, more creativity, and more kindness&mdash;and many Portlanders have stepped up to the challenge. Cities are now at the forefront of addressing complex challenges such as housing, racial equity, and sustainability. I'm grateful to get to work on these and many other vital issues as your Commissioner. <br /><br />Best wishes for a new year,<br /><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=671818"" alt="""" width=""124"" height=""40.1542525092"" /><br /><em>Commissioner Chloe Eudaly</em><br /><br /></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/eudaly/article/671819
Commissioner's Blog,685588,Thoughts on the 2018-19 Budget,2,,2018-05-30 18:44:22 UTC,2018-05-24 21:38:00 UTC,A,,"<p>This year&rsquo;s City&rsquo;s budget process didn&rsquo;t work well for city bureaus, the public, or Council. It didn&rsquo;t entirely make sense to ask bureaus to offer across the board cut packages in a year when the city has more resources available. Bureaus were forced to offer draconian cut packages that alarmed and activated community members. Activated community members predictably showed up at community budget hearings to protest cuts to programs they care about with little or no knowledge or consideration of other budget issues. As we know, some groups are better able to mobilize that others and many of the urgent matters that we need to address were not reflected by the turnout and many voices were barely able to be heard over the din. When all was said and done, community centers were all funded while other equally or more important programs and initiatives were not. We need a more thoughtful and meaningful process that will enable city bureaus, the public and the City Council to work together in understanding and prioritizing the complex budgeting challenges we face. <br /> <br /> This budget does do some great work to address our most urgent issues, and I&rsquo;d like to highlight a few of them:</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve dedicated $500K to Universal Defense.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our federal administration continues to target and terrorize Portland&rsquo;s immigrant communities, I am grateful to be in a position to be able to do something about it. This is an important moment and I am proud to be part of a Council that is on the right side of history on this issue. Thank you Mayor Wheeler for including this add package in your proposed budget and continuing to support it.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve increased our contribution to the Joint Office of Homeless Services by $3M.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are serving more people facing challenges around affordability, eviction, and homelessness than ever. Unfortunately, what the city and county are actually doing to address houselessness gets lost in distracting debates about Wapato or other well-intentioned, but not well-informed approaches. Investing $31.2 million in the Joint Office of Homeless Services will fund the hard work that doesn&rsquo;t make headlines, but does make a critical difference for thousands of our most vulnerable community members.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re Increasing the Business License Tax for the first time in decades.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The rising tide of prosperity in Portland is not lifting all boats. In fact, as the increasing number of people who are insecure in their housing and becoming homeless demonstrates, things are getting worse, not better for many people in Portland. Increasing the BLT now is a great first step toward recognizing how we can divert part of that rising tide to help the people who are struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p><br /> I am worried about some of the expenditures in this budget. The Council Budget Office started the budget process with an appeal to consider the sustainability of the city&rsquo;s finances. This budget generates more ongoing resources but increasing authorized staffing at the Portland Police Bureau by 49 positions comes with significant new permanent funding obligations. Business tax revenues will fluctuate with the economy. We are setting ourselves up for a very difficult conversation by making new ongoing commitments to funding more police officers with a funding source that we know is subject to economic forces beyond our control.</p>
<p>Despite my remaining questions and concerns, I respect and want to support Chief Outlaw as she continues to implement her vision for the PPB. And there are some:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhancing the Behavioral Health Unit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating a Houseless Community Engagement Liaison position</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding Data Analytics to Support Equity and Diversity Goals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Securing Resources for the Traffic Division to Enforce Vision Zero</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the Mayor&rsquo;s budget note on a deadline for filling the long overdue Community Service Officer positions and my budget note on decreasing the bureaus reliance on overtime, an expensive and undesirable practice.</p>
<p>There are issues that did not get resolved in this budget, I&rsquo;d like to highlight a couple of the most important issues that need more work:</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Coalition Offices.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Coalition offices are important partners in our efforts to connect community to government. The audit in 2016 revealed what many have known for a long time: East Portland&rsquo;s population continues to grow rapidly while funding for the coalition office has remained the same. It was important that we address this disparity now, which is why we requested additional funding.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that we were not able to secure the additional funding for the East Portland Neighborhood Office. I want to acknowledge that while East Portland has a rapidly growing population, all of the coalition offices are serving more people than they ever have. This is why I am working hard to reduce the fiscal impact of the rebalancing that will need to occur this year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve identified $44,000 in existing bureau fund dollars that we will direct to EPNO in addition to the $30,000 we&rsquo;ve received in this proposed budget. I am also working with the Budget Office to redirect cost savings from my office budget to the coalitions.</p>
<p>ONI Director, Suk Rhee, and I are committed to working with all of the coalitions to develop a long-term method for equitably distributing funding. I also look forward to brainstorming new ways to structure this work, and finding efficiencies and cost-savings, so that we can continue to strengthen all of our neighborhood coalitions.</p>
<p><strong>ADU Financing.</strong></p>
<p>It is vital that we identify ways for Portlanders to share in the prosperity associated with growth before we move forward with plans for infill. We have a turnkey opportunity to do that by developing a financing mechanism for ADU development. I plan to spend the summer working with my colleagues to develop the support necessary to fund this plan in the Fall budget process.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed that this item was not fully funded. I agree that the city should provide accommodations as part of its normal course of business and that bigger bureaus should use existing resources to comply with the law. Smaller bureaus and their community partners do not have enough ongoing resources to provide accommodations with existing resources. We need a long-term strategy to address this problem.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy that we were able to work together to get to consensus about the budget. During these chaotic times in politics, it is important to demonstrate that local government can work together to overcome differences and make progress on the most urgent issues in our community.</p>
<p>My thanks go out to my colleagues, bureau directors and staff, my office staff, the Council Budget Office, and especially to the community members who serve us in an advisory capacity and all those who came to our budget listening sessions.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/eudaly/article/685588
Commissioner's Blog,696832,A Love Letter to the Arts,2,,2018-09-05 21:08:09 UTC,2018-09-05 20:37:00 UTC,A,,"<p>Dear Portlanders,</p>
<p>What an exciting honor to be entrusted with our City&rsquo;s Arts Portfolio! It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to work with Commissioner&nbsp;Nick Fish, the previous Arts Commissioner, and our collaboration is bound to continue in new and innovative ways through our newly assigned bureaus. By way of an introduction, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my background and experience in the arts, that of my staff, as well as a few of my priorities.</p>
<p>The arts have always been an essential part of my life. Family legend has it that I started singing before I could talk. I also had the good fortune of early exposure to the arts, including music and dance lessons, ceramics and art classes, music, theater, and other cultural experiences. I sang in choir all through school and played clarinet and saxophone in my middle school band. Although I am a lifelong bookworm, as a teenager and young adult, my social life revolved around music (followed closely by film). My first concerts were at legendary Portland venues like the Starry Night, Pine Street Theater, Satyricon, The X-Ray Caf&eacute;, and Blue Gallery. I also regularly attended First Thursdays (and Last Thursday House events). My favorite galleries in those early days included Jamison/Thomas Gallery, Blackfish, and Northwest Artist&rsquo;s Workshop.</p>
<p>In 1994 I opened a small specialty bookshop called Reading Frenzy which was devoted to independent, small press, and self-published titles. It became a hub of activity for local writers, artists, publishers, and readers. A few years later my friend Rebecca Gilbert and I co-founded a space for Portlanders to produce their own printed matter called the&nbsp;Independent Publishing Resource Center&nbsp;(IPRC), which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. I also exhibited monthly art shows featuring unknown, emerging, and sometimes established artists, as well as the occasional oddball collection. In the final years of the bookshop/gallery, the majority of our exhibits featured women, LGBTQ, people of color, and artists with disabilities. All told, I produced around 500 literary and arts events from 1994 to 2016.</p>
<p>Through Reading Frenzy I collaborated with many arts organizations and institutions including the&nbsp;Portland Art Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Craft, and&nbsp;PNCA - Pacific Northwest College of Art. I was also a flagship member of the Multnomah County Cultural Coalition, a group of artists, educators, and administrators entrusted with awarding grants funded by our Oregon Cultural Trust dollars, where I brought an emphasis on accessibility to the arts for people with disabilities and previously overlooked grassroots arts organizations.</p>
<p>The Arts Portfolio includes the&nbsp;Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council&nbsp;(RACC), the Arts Access and Education Fund,&nbsp;Portland'5 Centers for the Arts, and working in partnership with the City of Portland&rsquo;s Creative Laureate&nbsp;<a class=""profileLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/subashini.ganesan.52?fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC4m-0QkBBwUUPVyJUvLzhpjWS7NMaiEcjTBD4fCHQcimabb-ibAReWejYLbsH9YqRwmZxEoX2mpc7enhsxFKe8dFatn27Ew5gL3qLqWfnd8xIHYBgm9cSFmnn5AoKQqJXpGI327N-YDh6aRvUVuLUU9ndK4UoDTDisGXfiSIdvrPrg2G5BOg&amp;__tn__=K-R"" data-hovercard=""/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=776987563&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D"" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=""1"">Subashini Ganesan</a>. My hope is that as a city we can provide more funding, support, and opportunity for artists and institutions, especially for small organizations and emerging artists. Spaces to live, create and exhibit or perform work are obviously critical to a thriving arts community, so affordability will continue to be a significant focus of my work. And of course, equitable access and education are vital to our entire community, so I intend to expand the excellent work already being done in this arena with our public dollars. I look forward to advancing these causes to ensure that current and future Portlanders from all walks of life can continue to participate, enjoy, and benefit from our rich and diverse cultural landscape.</p>
<p>Finally, I am thrilled to be putting the decades of experience in the arts that my staff brings to City Hall to use. Marshall Runkel, my Chief of Staff, was the Arts Liaison for Commissioner Erik Sten and has served on the boards of RACC,&nbsp;Open Signal: Portland Community Media Center&nbsp;(previously Portland Community Media),&nbsp;DISJECTA, and helped numerous arts organizations and venues navigate our permitting processes. Robin Mullins, my Executive Assistant, has worked for nearly every presenting performing arts organization in Portland, including&nbsp;White Bird, Portland Taiko, and Portland Opera. And I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that the Arts Liaison in my office will be Pollyanne Faith Birge. Pollyanne brings years of experience that ranges from her previous arts and culture policy coordination, outreach, and development for Mayor Sam Adams, to arts administration having served as Executive Director of the&nbsp;Independent Publishing Resource Center&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Oregon Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts. She also has a wealth of experience in event management, having produced numerous arts-focused events for my office, from George Thorn Day to the Chirgilchin Tuvan Throat Singers to the Nat Turner Project to Dead Moon Night.</p>
<p>I'm so excited for our shared opportunity to serve, support, and shape the future of the arts in Portland, both inside and out of City Hall, with all of you!</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bureau of Development Services Issues</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since assuming responsibility for the Bureau of Development Services (BDS) in January of 2017, my staff and I have taken a series of actions to improve service delivery and customer service at the bureau. Over the course of the last 19 months, I have gained great appreciation for the work that BDS staff does to make a difficult and at times dysfunctional system work. When I was assigned the bureau, the version of the permitting software that tracked over $3 billion in development projects in 2017 was no longer supported by the vendor that created it.</p>
<p>BDS is now using a supported version of the permitting software and is on track to make major improvements in its approach to technology as well as many other areas. I&rsquo;m writing to offer a snapshot of the work that has occurred during my tenure as Commissioner in Charge of the bureau and a summary of ongoing projects and opportunities for future improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments.</strong></p>
<p>Permitting System Improvements - One of my first official acts as the Commissioner with responsibility for BDS was to attend a Government Accountability Transparency and Results (GATR) presentation that was organized by the City Budget Office and focused on development review issues. The presentation highlighted specific pinch points in the review process, difficulties associated with having multiple bureaus engaged in the process and the impact that staffing levels have on development review timelines. In response, BDS convened the bureau directors of all the bureaus involved in the development review process to identify process improvements and resolve policy conflicts. BDS reinvented its hiring process to go from being one of the slowest bureaus to one of the fastest bureaus and has made significant progress in relieving pinch point pressure as documented by <a href=""/cbo/article/678998"">an updated GATR presentation this spring</a>. Despite limited resources and direction from myself and the Mayor to prioritize permitting for affordable housing and other important projects (Adidas expansion, Providence Park, school projects, and others), BDS staff processed an historic amount of permits in 2017 while maintaining or improving service delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Re-organization. </strong></p>
<p>Since I appointed her to be the interim Director of BDS, April 17, 2017, BDS Director Rebecca Esau has launched an ambitious effort to re-organize the bureau to address a span of control issues as well as to identify and correct gaps in services, particularly for historically underserved members of the community. Rebecca and I worked closely with Dora Perry, the bureau&rsquo;s equity manager, and union leaders to improve morale and address systemic human resource problems at BDS. New service delivery initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A communications team to help customers navigate the permitting process</li>
<li>A small business &amp; arts team to help small business owners and arts organizations</li>
<li>A permitting solutions team to help people with outstanding liens and/or code violations on their property</li>
<li>A cannabis facilities team to help cannabis entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hazardous Materials and Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) System Development Charges (SDC) Policies. </strong></p>
<p>The rapid appreciation of real estate values in our city has caused a wave of demolitions of existing homes. Unfortunately, while remodelers have to comply with strict containment and clean up requirements when working around hazardous materials (primarily lead and asbestos), demolition contractors had much less effective regulations for protecting the public from hazardous materials. Senator Michael Dembrow and Representative Alissa Keny-Guyer passed legislation enabling local governments to enact better hazardous materials policies, SB 871, during the 2017 legislative session. I worked with the construction industry, neighborhood leaders and public health officials to adopt new regulations shortly after the new state law was signed by Governor Kate Brown. This summer, I led the effort to permanently exempt ADUs from SDCs, but to limit the exemption to ADUs that will not be listed on short term rental platforms. This was the first in a series of policy actions that I will bring forward to support the development of ADUs, as part of the City&rsquo;s efforts to address the current housing crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Projects.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Online Permitting System (POPS) &ndash; As I noted at the beginning of this memo, BDS is in the middle of implementing a new permitting software system with assistance from the Bureau of Technology Services (BTS). The most important and promising aspect of the new system is the portion of the project that will transition the review of permits from paper to digital plan review.&nbsp; This change will allow people to submit plans remotely and make corrections to them electronically from their home or office, without having to travel downtown to the Permit Center. It will be a tremendous leap forward in efficiency for City reviewers from BDS and the five other bureaus involved in permit plan review. The first commercial building permit using the new ePlan system is underway and the bureau will be rolling it out for more types of projects over the next 18 months until ALL projects can be processed online. Please check out <a href=""https://youtu.be/EaIYdmOK_8U"">this great video about the project</a>.</p>
<p>Liens &ndash; BDS has over $20 million in outstanding liens for building code violations. An analysis of properties that have had liens assessed against them revealed that over 65% of outstanding liens are in neighborhoods that meet the Housing Bureau&rsquo;s definition of rapidly appreciating neighborhoods. Auditor Caballero&rsquo;s staff will be doing further analysis of liens in the coming months. Ideally, that analysis will help inform the development of a new approach to code enforcement that enables the City to assist people that are struggling to comply with building codes while moving more quickly and effectively to compel owners whose neglect of their properties causes problems for neighbors and whole neighborhoods to correct problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant Protections &ndash; BDS is working on a number of projects that contribute to the city&rsquo;s focus on affordable housing and improved tenant protections. Bureau staff have begun the RFP process to renew the bureau&rsquo;s popular training for landlords. The goal is to shift the focus of the training away from viewing tenants as potential criminals and toward seeing tenants as partners in housing.&nbsp; I am excited about making sure this training is back up and running by Spring 2019. BDS is also ready to update building maintenance regulations in Title 29 of the City Code based on recommendations made by a task force and approved by council several years ago. These changes will ensure that tenants have access to livable units free from mold and pests. The Code changes have been drafted and after public review, I expect the changes will be ready to come to council by the end of this year.&nbsp; Additionally, BDS is supportive of developing a mandatory inspections program for rental housing, and Portland Housing Bureau&rsquo;s current voluntary registration program of rentals is an essential first step in making that a reality.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, I recommend that BDS leverage its proprietary data and its relationships with the development community to establish a leadership role on development issues by sharing its data and insights with the community. BDS could produce an annual summary of development activity, trends, and its forecast for future activity. The bureau could share this information via a City Club Friday Forum and/or events with local news organizations that focus on development. The absence of real, readily accessible data about development activity in Portland has led to a proliferation of baseless hypotheses about what is occurring. We shouldn&rsquo;t waste time arguing about facts: BDS can help our community identify and address real issues by doing a better job of sharing its data and insights.</p>
<p>I have the utmost confidence that Mayor Wheeler will continue to support the ongoing projects listed above and am ready to assist with moving them forward. I will stay engaged in helping improve the permitting process as the PBOT Commissioner and look forward to staying in touch with development review issues.</p>

Commissioner's Blog,702660,Commissioner Eudaly's Questions on the Proposed Protest Ordinance,2,,2018-11-09 18:35:39 UTC,2018-11-09 18:30:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">November 8, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commissioner Eudaly&rsquo;s Questions* on the Proposed Protest Ordinance</strong></p>
<p><em>*</em><a href=""/auditor/article/702053""><em>1160</em></a><em>&nbsp; TIME CERTAIN: 2:15 PM &ndash; Authorize the Commissioner in Charge of the Police Bureau to order content-neutral time, place and manner regulations for demonstrations held in the City (Ordinance introduced by Mayor Wheeler) 2 hours 45 minutes requested</em></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Past Incidents/Crowd Management and Use of Force Policies</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Since 2017, PPB has acknowledged the use of at least six different types of &ldquo;riot control agents and less lethal impact munitions,&rdquo; including pepper spray, rubber ball distraction devices, flash grenades, etc. How much does the Bureau spend on these types of devices? Has spending on these devices increased in recent years?</li>
<li>In 1970, the Police Bureau committed to not using violence on non-violent protestors. How many settlements have there been with protestors since then related to excessive use of force by police during demonstrations? What is the estimated cost of these suits?</li>
<li>How many pending lawsuits are there against the City from protestors or advocacy organizations for demonstrations between November 2016 and now? What is the estimated cost to the City to defend PPB in these lawsuits?</li>
<li>In response to this proposed ordinance, Daryl Turner&rsquo;s recently decried the &ldquo;over-emphasis on de-escalation and disengagement.&rdquo; Is this view on de-escalation consistent with that of PPB leadership?</li>
<li>How should we reconcile PPB&rsquo;s stated commitment to de-escalation with the numerous injuries we&rsquo;ve witnessed on our streets, of which the most serious appear to be at the hands of the police? Please note these injuries include third degree chemical burns, open wounds, and a traumatic brain injury.</li>
<li>Why do the police believe that after they give dispersal orders, people who remain are fair game to be subjected to violence, even though they are not committing any violent act by remaining?</li>
<li>What are the conditions that have to be in place for PPB to demand a dispersal order?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard feedback that dispersal orders are often contradictory, difficult to understand, or given without enough time for people to respond. What has PPB done to remedy this?</li>
<li>From the videos I&rsquo;ve seen, it appears that counter-demonstrators are always the ones who are asked to disperse. Is this true?</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>Where is the evidence that the counterdemonstrators threw projectiles at police before the police began using violence in any of the recent demonstrations?</li>
<li>How is it legal to subject everyone in a crowd to chemicals, flash-bang grenades and other dangerous weapons when there is no individualized reasonable suspicion that they are committing crimes, much less violent crimes?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard PPB leadership describe the tactical challenge of sending in officers to pluck out individuals from rowdy crowds. How do other police departments deal with this issue?</li>
<li>Have you looked to other police departments for &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for crowd management? Are there any examples of good policing?</li>
<li>My understanding is the Crowd Control Directive excludes officers&rsquo; right to use violence against people who are not engaged in active resistance. Is this a correct interpretation? If so, how does PPB reconcile this with the many injuries of protestors we&rsquo;ve witnessed.</li>
<li>How does having armed and armored police lined up facing a crowd help create a safe space for people to express their First Amendment protected speech? What alternatives have been considered?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Perceived PPB Bias</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Portlanders have sustained countless injuries at the hands of the Portland Police Bureau. I can&rsquo;t recall of any instances of protestors from Proud Boys or Patriot Prayer being seriously injured by police. Is this accurate? If so, how do you explain this?</li>
<li>How do you explain the perception, if not reality, that PPB see Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys as &ldquo;more mainstream&rdquo; than Portlanders who come to stand up to them?</li>
<li>The Mercury recently reported that more PPB officers live in Washington (177) than in Portland proper (158). How can we confidently say this has no bearing on actual or perceived officer biases?</li>
<li>Last summer, Portland activists were &ldquo;kettled&rdquo; and forced to provide ID. I still do not understand why this happened. Can you help us understand why that happened? Has PPB ever recorded identification information from the Patriot Prayer or Proud Boys groups in this manner?</li>
<li>Why is it that PPB seems to always be facing counterdemonstrators instead of the far-right paramilitary gangs that come to take over our streets? Has there ever been consideration of how this tactical decision actually empowers the alt-right groups, which makes Portland less safe for all?</li>
<li>What efforts has PPB made to reach out to Portland activists and advocates to discuss policing of protests?</li>
<li>Can the Portland Police Bureau explicitly and unequivocally state that Patriot Prayer, Proud Boys, and similar alt-right, white supremacist gangs are the real threat to our public safety?</li>
<li>During the August 4 protest, my understanding was there were weapons check-points because of the threat of gun violence. Yet, media reports indicate that the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer were able to breeze by these check-points. Can you explain what happened? Why was no one arrested?</li>
<li>Much has been made of the &ldquo;cache of weapons&rdquo; that were discovered on the parking garage. Can you explain why no arrests were made in that situation?</li>
<li>In many of the protests, I&rsquo;ve witnessed Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys crossing the street and into the side of the road sectioned off for counter-demonstrators while PPB looked on. Why was this allowed to occur?</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>The Anti-Defamation League&rsquo;s Center on Extremism has reported that 71 percent of the extremist-related fatalities in the United States between 2008 and 2017 were committed by members of the far right or white-supremacist movements. Why is this, and more local data that we have at our disposal, not enough information to justify &ldquo;selective enforcement&rdquo; to address the actual threats to our public safety?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Follow-Up from Past Violence</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>At this point, we&rsquo;ve seen countless videos of Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys violently assaulting Portlanders and can identify them by face if not also by name. Can you detail the steps that PPB has taken to follow-up and arrest these folks?</li>
<li>Why are these white supremacist gang members not being prosecuted more harshly?</li>
<li>It appears to me that the &ldquo;tool&rdquo; PPB need is more effective collaboration with the DA&rsquo;s office. Has the Mayor&rsquo;s office or PPB talked to the DA about this? What was the outcome of these discussions?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ordinance Questions </span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Have other cities with similar Time, Place, Manner (TPM) restrictions been sued for these policies? How much did it cost them to defend these policies in court?</li>
<li>Given that the constitutionality of this ordinance has been called into question by multiple experts, is the city prepared to defend this in court, including through appeals? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Are there any other cities using TPM restrictions as a tool to combat alt-right violence?</li>
<li>How exactly does this ordinance lead to less enforcement or less use of police resources? The limits are surely to be tested, so isn&rsquo;t it possible that this policy will actually lead to more confrontations?</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>This ordinance is certain to face a legal challenge, what do you anticipate will be the legal costs associated with defending this policy in court?</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>If so, has the city estimated the cost of that litigation to the public?</li>
<li>Does the mayor believe that this is the legal fight worth having with our limited city resources?</li>
<li>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more responsible to spend our city attorneys&rsquo; time and public funds pursuing legal strategies with existing tools to stop the recruitment and mobilization of white supremacist, paramilitary gangs on our streets?</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>There are aspects of this that are very reminiscent of the gang database. The ordinance give the mayor or police commissioner to designate &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as having a&nbsp; history of violence with other &ldquo;groups,&rdquo; and based on that designation, restrict the first amendment rights of those &ldquo;groups&rdquo; and individuals the police believe to be associated with those groups.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How will the Police Commissioner make determinations that a &ldquo;group&rdquo; has committed violent acts in the past and what level of &ldquo;violence&rdquo; is required for this designation?</li>
<li>How will the Police Commissioner determine who is part of the groups and who is not?</li>
</ul>
<ol type=""1"">
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Will the rules apply to people who are not part of the groups targeted by the rules, such as people who are unassociated with either group and have no history of violence, but want to counter-protest one of the groups?</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<li>If a person is already willing to violate criminal laws against assault, are they actually going to follow these rules about when, where and for how long to protest?</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>The ordinance would allow the restriction of first amendment rights based on a determination that a planned demonstration presents a &ldquo;substantial likelihood of violence&rdquo; based on any &ldquo;credible information obtained by law enforcement.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How exactly can a city official predict a likelihood of violence occurring?</li>
</ul>
<ol type=""1"">
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Is there any guidance as to what level of certainty the Commissioner would need to have from this &ldquo;credible evidence&rdquo; before he can preemptively limit a protest?</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<li>If the plan is to set up free speech zones, will opposing groups be within line of sight of each other, or is the plan to place them far away from each other?</li>
<li>How exactly can PPB and the Police Commissioner limit the number of people in a group at a march?</li>
<li>What if a protest organically and quickly comes together in response to current events, will the ordinance apply to those types of events?</li>
<li>If this is aimed at events that are being planned in advance of their occurrence, how far in advance of the protest will the rules be put out, and how will the City make certain that members of the public have copies of the written ordinance with sufficient advance notice to comply?</li>
<li>If a group disputes the characterization of their members as having a history of violence, how can they challenge that? What if the characterization was false and there wasn&rsquo;t ample time to dispute it?</li>
<li>Could one group&rsquo;s right to protest be endangered by another group showing up at their protests and provoking violent encounters, with the aim of giving the group a &ldquo;history of violence&rdquo; (aka a heckler&rsquo;s veto)</li>
</ol><ol type=""1"">
<li>The ordinance states that people who violate it would be subject to criminal penalties. Is this ordinance creating a new crime? If not, what criminal offense or offenses is the being referenced in the ordinance?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

Commissioner's Blog,710395,Public Engagement on the I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project,2,,2019-01-24 01:02:46 UTC,2019-01-24 00:31:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""content-left""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Dear Friends,</span></p>
<p class=""content-left"">Over the next two months, we have the chance to shape the transportation future of our city, and I&rsquo;m urging you to take it.</p>
<p>In mid-February, the 30-day public comment period for the environmental assessment of the I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project will open. On March 7th, a Public Open House will be held, followed by a Public Hearing on March 12th. We have been successful in delaying forward movement on the I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project in order to allow the community time to mobilize on this issue, and we are continuing to push for an extension of the public comment period to maximize public engagement. And we are working with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to form a steering committee to advise on thoughtful, community-oriented execution.</p>
<p>We are prioritizing public engagement because this project is one of the most significant transportation efforts in recent years. It will have an enormous impact on how people from across the region and even across the state travel to, through, and around Portland. I want to ensure that this project reflects our values, particularly our commitment to equity, sustainability, and safety.</p>
<p>ODOT and other state transportation leaders need to hear that the I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project must do more than make it easier to merge on highways in the Rose Quarter. Consistent with Central City 2035 (adopted by City Council in May 2018), a project that focuses exclusively on the comfort of highway drivers is unacceptable. This is why the City partnered with ODOT to ensure that this venture prioritizes the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers. It should make it dramatically easier and safer for people walking, biking, taking transit, and driving in the Rose Quarter.</p>
<p>I also want them to hear that this development must reconnect the Lower Albina district with the rest of the Rose Quarter. The original I-5 project went right through the heart of this vibrant African American neighborhood, isolating it from the rest of the city and cutting it off from economic development in the Rose Quarter. It&rsquo;s time that we begin to remedy the harmful legacy of these past decisions. The I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project should be a catalyst for a flourishing Lower Albina that shares in our city&rsquo;s economic vitality.</p>
<p>I am confident that if we raise our voices together, we can continue to make improvements. Remember how this project started out: in 1987, when redevelopment was first proposed, it was an old-fashioned highway expansion project. It would have had tremendous impacts on surface streets in the Rose Quarter and also would have done very little for the safety and comfort of people traveling on local streets. Finally, it would have maintained the isolation of Lower Albina.</p>
<p>But that is not where we ended up. Instead, Portlanders pushed for a better project. They participated in countless committee meetings, planning sessions, and open houses. Gradually, we evolved from a freeway-focused project to one with fewer community impacts and safer and more accessible local connections.</p>
<p>Now is the time to push this evolution further and faster. Please join me during the public comment period, at the Public Open House, and at the Public Hearing, to advocate for an I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project that works for all of us.</p>

Commissioner's Blog,725615,Commissioner Eudaly's Statement on the New Zealand Attacks & Islamophobia,2,,2019-03-15 22:41:11 UTC,2019-03-15 22:40:00 UTC,A,,"<p>Dear Portlanders,</p>
<p>My heart goes out to the victims and their loved ones devastated by the terrorist attack in New Zealand. This tragedy is a stark reminder that white supremacy kills, and even though this act of violence took place across the globe it hits close to home. It is appalling, and no person should fear for their life anywhere in our community &ndash; particularly a house of worship.</p>
<p>If you experience or witness hate-motivated violence, particularly Islamophobia given these events in Christchurch, please report it and learn about additional available resources through Portland United Against Hate&rsquo;s ReportHatePDX.com. They offer reporting tools, access to resources like counseling, victim advocacy, and training opportunities from 13 community-based organizations.</p>
<p>We cannot forget that many of our Muslim neighbors, friends, and family are targeted daily here in Portland. I want to say to the Muslim community in our city that Portland stands with you: you are welcome here, you are treasured, and we will protect you.</p>
<p>With love,</p>

<p>Over the past few years, City Council meetings have been repeatedly interrupted by the<br />disruptive or aggressive behavior of some individuals of the public attending the meetings. This<br />loss of civility and disruption has become more frequent, almost to the point it has become the<br />new ""norm"". More and more often the disruptive behavior continues, despite the direction of the<br />Mayor or presiding officer to cease the behavior. In some cases, this disruption becomes so<br />significant that the Mayor/presiding officer needs to calls a recess of the Council meeting until<br />the individuals causing the disruption are removed from the meeting. Such disruptive behavior<br />not only delays the ability of the City Council to effectively conduct City business, in some cases<br />the behavior creates a hostile or threatening environment for Council members, City staff, and<br />other members of the public in attendance.</p>
