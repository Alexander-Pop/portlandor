<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler today announced bureau assignments. Under Portland&rsquo;s commission form of government, the mayor has the responsibility of assigning bureaus to commissioners to manage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goal in assigning bureaus is to rely on the experience and interests of each commissioner to achieve real results on behalf of Portlanders,&rdquo; said Wheeler. &ldquo;Portland government can be siloed. That prevents teamwork. I want to get commissioners and bureaus to work together like never before.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />January 5, 2017<br />Contact: Michael Cox 503-823-6593</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>City Prevails in Anderson Ratepayer Case</strong><br /><em>With this and other related decisions the city has saved Portland taxpayers over $100 million</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Today Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge Stephen Bushong issued his opinion on the remaining claims in the Anderson ratepayer case. The City prevailed on every major claim. With this and other related decisions the city has saved Portland taxpayers over $100 million.</p>
<p>Judge Bushong upheld the use of Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) funds in the investigation and defense of the Portland Harbor Superfund Listing. The City was named as a potentially responsible party primarily due to its operation of the BES conveyance system.</p>
<p>The City will continue to defend the interests of ratepayers and taxpayers by working to ensure that those primarily responsible for the contamination pay their fair share to clean up the river. As the City Council has indicated, once the allocation process is complete Council will re-allocate costs as appropriate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commissioner Fish and I share a vision for our utility bureaus that focuses on the responsible use of public resources,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;I am pleased that the Court agrees that Council has acted appropriately in its use of ratepayer funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, Judge Bushong upheld the use of BES and Water Bureau funds for grants related to those bureaus&rsquo; missions, such as the Water Bureau&rsquo;s sponsorship of the Sandy River Basin Watershed Council, which partners with private landowners, residents and others to improve the health and habitat of the Sandy River and its tributaries, including the Bull Run River. The judge also approved of BES&rsquo;s sponsorship of public outreach initiatives required as part of the Portland&rsquo;s State-issued stormwater permit.</p>
<p>Finally, Judge Bushong found that the Water Bureau&rsquo;s grant of System Development Charge exemptions is authorized by the Portland City Charter.</p>

Press Releases,624867,Statement from Mayor Ted Wheeler on Weekend Demonstrations,1,,2017-02-01 18:51:32 UTC,2017-01-23 19:41:00 UTC,A,,"<p>""Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people - perhaps more than 100,000 - exercised their right to assembly in our city. My top priority is always to protect the safety of everyone involved. Additionally, I want to try to limit acts of vandalism and disruptions to transit. By these measures the weekend was highly successful. In the end, no one entered the freeways, and acts of vandalism and transit disruption were minimized. There were five arrests and no serious injuries were reported.</p>
<p>""The Police Chief and I clearly communicated our expectations prior to demonstrations. When possible the City contacted and coordinated with event organizers to prevent what's happened in the past: acts of violence, vandalism, and disruption that lasted into the early morning hours. Generally speaking, the higher the degree of coordination between the city and event organizers, the smoother the event.</p>
<p>""The vast majority of participants in demonstrations were there for one reason - to peacefully demonstrate. Unfortunately, in any gathering of this size there is always the potential that some will have different goals - to incite conflict and confrontation. No one likes to see the use of crowd control devices. I certainly don't. When these devices are used, I want to be sure that they are used under the proper circumstances. Early indications are that their use on Friday night was appropriate. I will of course review post-action reports to make sure that was the case.""</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s Statement on President Trump&rsquo;s Repeal of the Clean Power Plan</strong></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement on President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order dismantling the Clean Power Plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newly confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and President Trump may make the misguided decision to try to destroy the Clean Power Plan. Our city and region will stay the course and move beyond coal and other fossil fuels. Portland is showing the rest of the country that clean energy, sustainable development, and walkable communities mean local action is a smarter choice than federal inaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>West Coast Governors and Mayors reaffirm their &ldquo;commitments to our communities to do what&rsquo;s right to keep our residents safe, secure, healthy and prosperous as we accelerate our clean energy economy and put the interest of our people before those of big polluters. We will continue to invest in clean energy that creates local jobs and keeps utility bills low, and we will electrify transportation to provide convenient, safe, and affordable ways to get around our cities, and make our neighborhoods healthy and vibrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />March 27, 2017<br />Contact: Michael Cox, 503-823-4046</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s Statement on AG&rsquo;s Comments and Recent ICE Actions in Portland</strong></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement on Attorney General Jeff Session&rsquo;s comments on sanctuary city&rsquo;s and recent ICE actions in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions again reiterated the Trump administration&rsquo;s threat to withhold funding from sanctuary cities. His comments provide barely more information than the already broad statements provided by the president himself. It is unclear whether the AG is referring to future grants, or to funds already provided. Also unclear is his legal ability to withhold funds DOJ funds from states under these conditions. It should be noted that DOJ grants to the City of Portland in our 2015-16 budget totaled just more than $3 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of this is happening in an environment that contains a lot of heated rhetoric but not a lot of facts. For example, just last week an Oregon Republican Party spokesman said that Portland&rsquo;s status as a sanctuary city means we are harboring, &ldquo;criminal illegal aliens who are murdering and raping.&rdquo; This statement is inaccurate and harmful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ICE arrest in Portland over the weekend demonstrates how wrongheaded this statement truly is. This weekend, ICE arrested Francisco J. Rodriguez Dominguez, a 25-year-old who has lived in the United States since he was five. Far from being a violent criminal, Francisco is a respected member of the community, a student and a volunteer. This arrest does nothing to promote public safety. Instead, actions like this only serve to tear apart our community and needlessly alter the lives of our residents. The city had no role in this arrest and I am against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today my administration spoke with both ICE and DOJ about our concern that their actions tremendous damage they are doing to the social, civic, and economic life of our city. The City of Portland, our police bureau, and our employees do not cooperate with ICE. However, ICE has the power to operate within our city, and does not have to inform us of their activities.

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Wheeler and Fritz announce grant to provide legal services to immigrants</strong></p>
<p>Commissioner Amanda Fritz announced today that she has filed an ordinance, cosponsored by Mayor Ted Wheeler, that will provide a grant of $50,000 to the Metropolitan Public Defender (MPD) for their newly formed <a href=""https://www.mpdlaw.com/?q=immigrantprotectionproject"">Immigrant Protection Project</a>. The project will provide legal services to immigrant communities in Portland through individual casework, as well as providing general information about immigration law and rights of individuals in the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immigrant and refugee families in the community are terrified and need immediate help determining what threats exist and preparing a legal plan for their safety and protection. Metropolitan Public Defender will work in the community through community-based organizations to help individuals and families with immigration cases, record clearing, family safety plans and protection from victimization&rdquo; stated Alex Bassos, Director of Community Law Division for MPD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mayor and I are committed not only to be a sanctuary city, but to also be a welcoming city&rdquo; said Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;By this action, we are putting City resources behind our words to protect the most vulnerable members of our community. Although the Courts are currently ruling against the Executive Order limiting entry, it is clear that there will be many attacks on constitutional rights in the next four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The directives coming out of Washington DC on immigration are disturbing and many members of our community are living in fear. This grant is a concrete step we can take to provide the legal advice and services that these vulnerable Portlanders need to protect their rights&rdquo;, stated Mayor Ted Wheeler.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Public Defender has set a budget of $250,000 for the project, which would allow the organization to hire two full-time immigration attorneys and support staff. &ldquo;The $50,000 from the City of Portland will be a significant boost and help us as we approach others to support this project&rdquo; Bassos said.</p>
<p>Many organizations have endorsed the project including, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Oregon, Oregon Law Center, Immigrant Refugee Community Organization (IRCO), Unite Oregon, Causa, Latino Network, and the Oregon Latino Health Coalition.</p>
<p>Portland City Council will hear the ordinance Wednesday morning, February 15 on the regular morning agenda.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Joint Statement by Mayor Ted Wheeler and Commissioner Dan Saltzman on Bringing Valuable Services to Residents and Visitors with CIVIQ Smartscapes Interconnected Smart City Ecosystem</strong><br /><em>The City is actively exploring opportunity to increase public engagement and efficiencies through CIVIQ</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler and Commissioner Dan Saltzman today announced that the City is actively exploring the opportunity to deploy CIVIQ&rsquo;s smart city solution in the City. The announcement was made at the NIST Global City Teams Challenge Super Action Cluster Summit on Transportation.</p>
<p>Representatives of the City are working with CIVIQ to develop plans to deploy CIVIQ Waypoints in and around Portland to bring interactive wayfinding, multi-modal transit info, free Wi-Fi and other valuable services to citizens and visitors to Portland.</p>
<p>The City of Portland has long been hailed as a nationwide model for mass transit and public transportation innovation and leadership. This year, the city is hosting the GCTC transportation summit where over 200 representatives from cities around the US and a number of other countries are gathering in Portland to share ideas and initiatives to make public transportation more accessible, more efficient and &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Besides offering interactive wayfinding and transportation information and free high-speed wi-fi service, the network of outdoor communications structures will also be capable of displaying emergency alerts and service outages, and will encourage citizen engagement with city officials through access to a City311 application.</p>
<p>Two dual high-brightness outdoor displays will be used for advertising, which will subsidize the cost of the network to the city with the goal of making it completely financially self-sufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think Portland is the ideal location to expand our Smartscaping concept, especially given the broad number of smart city initiatives already underway here,&rdquo; Brad Gleeson, Chief Commercial Officer, CIVIQ Smartscapes. &ldquo;We are excited to be working with Portland officials to incorporate transit objectives, digital equity goals and urban data collection capabilities into the solution for Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to explore a new, innovative way to engage residents with the city. By meeting people where they are with an easily accessible hub of services, the city can enhance its communication and response with the public,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy with the partnership with CIVIQ,&rdquo; said Commissioner Dan Saltzman, &ldquo;It will make it easier for residents, especially those in East Portland, to get vital information about all their transportation options. By helping all Portlanders get from place to place quickly and safely, this is smart city innovation at its best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For more than 150 years, Portland has been a destination for those wanting to apply their hard work to the purpose of creating a better life for themselves and their families. My own family made the trek on the Oregon Trail. We are a city built on immigration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to run from that history. We will not be complicit in the deportation of our neighbors. Under my leadership as Mayor, the City of Portland will remain a welcoming, safe place for all people regardless of immigration status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This approach is consistent with the Oregon state law and the 4th and 10th Amendments of the United States Constitution. We will not compromise our values as a city or as Americans and will resist these policies.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s First Budget Takes Action to Address Long-Standing City Challenges</strong><br /><em>Topping the list of priorities are homelessness, livability, road maintenance, community policing, housing, and resilience.</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler today rolled out his first proposed budget, making significant investments to address the real concerns of everyday Portlanders. Topping the list of priorities are homelessness, livability, road maintenance, community policing, housing, and resilience.</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;These are the issues I hear about every day when I talk to Portlanders,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;My budget makes significant investments in the things people care about that city government is uniquely positioned to address.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>To address <strong>HOMELESSNESS</strong>, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget will include:</p>
<p>&bull; More than $25 million in General Fund resources to the Joint Office of Homeless Services, matching the County&rsquo;s commitment, to invest in supportive housing, diversion programs, rapid rehousing, shelter, and system coordination.</p>
<p>To improve <strong>LIVABILITY</strong>, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget:</p>
<p>&bull; Adds four park rangers to patrol the Springwater Corridor and parks in East Portland to ensure our parks remain livable spaces that are open to all. In addition, adds five rangers to retain patrol services in the central business district so that downtown and the waterfront remain vibrant and welcoming during the evening hours.</p>
<p>&bull; Manages the impacts of camping on neighborhoods, the right of way, and other City-owned property by increasing efforts to remove trash, needles, and semi-permanent structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Expands the Office of Neighborhood Involvement&rsquo;s Graffiti Abatement Program to address the recent uptick in graffiti to fund an additional 1.2 million square feet of removal.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintains timely and effective customer service in response to noise complaints, maintains live answering of the noise hotline, and provides adequate administrative support to sustain the Noise Control program.</p>
<p>&bull; Improve abandoned and dilapidated properties in neighborhoods throughout the City, moving forward with foreclosures on vacant and distressed residential properties.</p>
<p>To improve <strong>ROADS and CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</strong>, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget includes:</p>
<p>&bull; A bold new plan, Build Portland, to invest $600 million over 20 years in upgrading our roads, parks and other civic infrastructure. The Mayor&rsquo;s budget makes an initial investment of $50 million in Build Portland, with additional investments of $100 million to $150 million every five years. The plan does not raise taxes and does not cut into existing services. Rather, by leveraging returning revenues from expiring Urban Renewal Districts, Build Portland will create a consistent, dedicated source of revenue to reverse our City&rsquo;s historical disinvestment in critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>&bull; Funding for five PBOT projects, including the upgrading of curb corners with ADA-accessible ramps, the replacement of five traffic signals, and the construction of a multi-use pathway on a major street. When completed, the transportation projects will not only result in better maintenance but also improve safety on the city&rsquo;s streets.<br />&bull; Funding for four Vision Zero safety projects: 1) Improve safety at the top five most dangerous intersections and construct improvements on two High Crash Corridors, 2) Identify safety improvements and build them at three priority transit stops along key bus routes, 3) Implement street design improvements to support reductions in speed limits on five streets, and 4) Eliminate deficiencies in PBOT&rsquo;s understanding of street safety through improved data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>To enhance our <strong>COMMUNITY POLICING</strong> efforts, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget:</p>
<p>&bull; Launches for the first time in Portland a Community Service Officer program, including twelve CSOs focused on engaging directly with the community, as well as undertaking work on livability issues to increase the amount of time patrol officers are able to spend on proactive community police work.</p>
<p>To improve <strong>HOUSING</strong> stability, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget:</p>
<p>&bull; Launches an Office of Landlord-Tenant Affairs. The office will develop a new rental unit registration program, collect and analyze data from the approximately 6,000 eviction notices currently filed through the Multnomah County court system, provide referrals to people at risk of or experiencing eviction to existing community services, and increase by five times the number of people served with fair housing legal assistance. In addition, the office will launch a new online affordable housing portal through NoAppFee, with enhanced customer service to help applicants understand and mitigate barriers to obtaining housing.</p>
<p>To improve our <strong>RESILIENCE</strong> to a natural or man-made disaster, the Mayor&rsquo;s budget:</p>
<p>&bull; Increases ongoing discretionary funding for the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management by a full 25%. This represents the largest increased investment for the bureau&rsquo;s operations in a decade.</p>
<p>&bull; More than doubles funds for the Neighborhood Emergency Team (NET) and Basic Earthquake Emergency Communication Node (BEECN) programs in the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management.</p>
<p>&bull; Creates a position to develop and manage a Citywide technology disaster plan.</p>
<p>&bull; Creates a new position in the Bureau of Planning &amp; Sustainability to coordinate Smart Cities efforts, which connect data generated by digital technologies to improve City services, optimize public resources, bolster resiliency, and develop new avenues for community engagement.</p>
<p>&bull; Enables PBOT to call on private contractors for snow plowing and removal services during extreme winter events. Purchases three snow plow blades so that we can leverage our existing investment in heavy vehicles to respond to these events.</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s economy is booming, with unemployment at its lowest point in decades and another record year for business license tax revenues,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;However, recent City budget trends reveal the need for a prudent fiscal approach and a renewed focus on the core responsibilities of City governance.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>Over the last year, the City has pledged $12.3 million in additional ongoing spending that has not been offset with other reductions. Many of these commitments are laudable, including investments in recruiting and retaining a quality police force and new ongoing funds dedicated to the Joint Office of Homelessness Services. Recognizing that the City would likely need to take some ongoing cuts to balance the five-year budget forecast, Mayor Wheeler requested that bureaus submit nearly $15 million in possible budget cuts.</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;My proposed budget focuses our limited resources on the things that make a real difference in the lives of Portland residents,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;By doing so we can put our city on the right track and set ourselves up for long-term success.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>

<p class=""content-center""><br /><strong>PBOT News Release:</strong><br /><strong>Mayor Wheeler, Commissioner Saltzman launch&#8232; Smart Autonomous Vehicles Initiative</strong></p>
<p class=""content-left""><br />(April 19, 2017) Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and City Commissioner Dan Saltzman today announced the Smart Autonomous Vehicles Initiative (SAVI). With this initiative, they directed the Portland Bureau of Transportation to develop autonomous vehicle policies and solicit proposals from companies that would test autonomous vehicles on Portland streets by the end of the year.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">At the Portland Business Alliance&rsquo;s April Forum Breakfast: &ldquo;The Road to Autonomous Vehicles,&rdquo; sponsored by Portland General Electric, Wheeler made the announcement. At a news conference after the breakfast, Wheeler and Saltzman signed a directive telling Leah Treat, director of PBOT, to launch the initiative.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s long history of transportation innovation is about to enter a new chapter,&rdquo; Wheeler said. &ldquo;My goal is to have an autonomous vehicle pilot program in Portland, working for Portlanders, by the end of the year. To the inventors, investors and innovators, I&rsquo;m here to say that Portland is open for business. By working with private industry, we can make sure that cutting edge technology expands access to public transit and reduces pollution and congestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">It&rsquo;s important for autonomous vehicles to improve safety, said Saltzman, the commissioner who oversees PBOT.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">&ldquo;Good rules allow business and government to work together, rather than at odds,&rdquo; Saltzman said. &ldquo;Autonomous vehicles can make our streets safer by taking human error out of the equation. As we work towards our Vision Zero goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries, the public has a right to expect that the city will help make sure that safety standards are met. Autonomous vehicles should help us meet our safety, equity, climate change and economic goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">In crafting this initiative, we will build on the experience and know-how we gained as a finalist in the USDOT&rsquo;s Smart City challenge last year, said Treat, the director of PBOT.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">&ldquo;This directive sets the framework for making smart choices about emerging technology,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;Realizing the potential of autonomous vehicles starts with making smart choices and setting clear standards that support the interests of the autonomous vehicle industry and our community. We will look to the first autonomous vehicle pilots for valuable information about the performance of AVs and how we can harness this technology to increase affordable transportation, reduce congestion and fight pollution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The directive tells PBOT to take four actions to advance SAVI within the next 60 days:</p>
<p class=""content-left"">1. Propose for City Council and public consideration Interim Transportation System Plan (TSP) policies that ensure connected and autonomous vehicles will serve Portland&rsquo;s safety, equity, climate change, and economic goals;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">2. Publish a Request for Information (RFI) that invites AV testing specific to advancing safety, equity, climate, and economic goals;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">3. Adopt an Interim Administrative Rule that provides a clear path to permit innovators to apply to test, pilot or deploy AVs in Portland; and</p>
<p class=""content-left"">4. Develop public engagement, reporting, and evaluation plans that ensure Portland residents, workers, and businesses have opportunities to shape the &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for AVs in Portland.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Portland General Electric (NYSE: POR), the largest electric utility in the metropolitan area, said the initiative could help grow the local economy and reduce emissions with electric vehicles.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">&ldquo;Evolving our transportation infrastructure is one of the great challenges, and the great opportunities, we face in the Portland region,&rdquo; said Charlie Allcock, Business Development Director for Portland General Electric. &ldquo;The transportation sector contributes over 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions here in Oregon. And increased traffic and congestion could put a damper on economic growth. We applaud Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s decision to make Portland a mecca for innovative solutions and new jobs, and will work closely with the city area as we move towards a smart, shared, self-driving and emission-free transportation future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The Portland announcement was praised by Transportation for America, a Washington, D.C-based alliance of elected, business and civic leaders from communities across the country that advocates for investment in smart, homegrown, locally-driven transportation solutions.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">&ldquo;Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reshape our cities, and we&rsquo;re excited to see that Portland is taking proactive steps to ensure that this coming transformation in urban mobility is harnessed effectively to move them closer to their economic, safety, equity and environmental goals,&rdquo; said Russ Brooks, Director of Smart Cities for Transportation for America. &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s commitment to engaging the public to shape this future together should be a model for other cities. And their push to work together with other local, regional and state leaders to flesh out state legislation that works for cities should be a model for the federal government as they progress toward making national policy for autonomous vehicles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement on Police Chief Mike Marshman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, after reviewing initial findings of the Independent Police Review investigation into Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman provided to me by Human Resources Director Anna Kanwit, I made the decision to return Chief Marshman to full duty effective immediately. The findings concluded that Chief Marshman did not violate the Police Bureau&rsquo;s directive on truthfulness, and does not appear to have violated any bureau directives. Chief Marshman has clearly and consistently stated his view that the same rules apply to every officer, regardless of rank, and I thank him for putting that belief into action during this process. I also want to thank Assistant Chief Chris Davis, bureau command, sworn officers, and professional staff. The IPR process can be disruptive, and all involved remained focused on the important work of the Police Bureau.&rdquo;</p>

Press Releases,635328,City and County leaders pledge to move to 100 percent renewable energy,1,,2017-04-11 15:44:30 UTC,2017-04-11 15:40:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />April 10, 2017<br />Contact: Michael Cox: 503-823-6593<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie Sullivan-Springhetti: 503-502-2741</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>City and County leaders pledge to move to 100 percent renewable energy</strong></p>
<p>City of Portland and Multnomah County leaders vowed today to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. The goal is to meet the community's electricity needs from renewable sources by 2035 and shift all remaining energy sources to renewables in the 15 years after. The City of Portland currently powers all of its operations with renewable energy and starting in 2018, Multnomah County will purchase green energy to meet its operational needs.</p>
<p>The announcement places the Portland-metro region alongside 25 other cities that have committed to 100 percent renewables, including Salt Lake City and San Diego. Nearly 90 major U.S. companies have also committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting our community to 100 percent renewable energy is a BIG goal,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo; And while it is absolutely ambitious, it is a goal that we share with Nike, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Google, GM, Coca Cola, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Walmart. We have a responsibility to lead this effort in Oregon.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pledge to our children&rsquo;s future,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Chair Deborah Kafoury. &ldquo;100 percent renewables means a future with cleaner air, a stable climate and more jobs and economic opportunity.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jeremy Clark, 12, said that &ldquo;The adults in this room- the leaders of Portland and Multnomah County - have great power. But with that great power comes a great responsibility. You have the responsibility of keeping my future bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me a lot of hope that the leaders of my community are promising today to drastically reduce our community&rsquo;s carbon emissions,&rsquo;&rsquo; Jeremy Clark said. &ldquo;Keeping our climate sustainable is the most important issue for the success of my generation. So, if you keep your promises made today, then in 20 - 30 years, you can say to your children and grandchildren, &ldquo;Together, we kept your future bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Getting to 100 percent renewable</strong></p>
<p class=""content-left"">Steps in the transition include fostering Portland-area firms that produce low-carbon and environmental goods and services; moving the City of Portland fleet to electric; supporting the City and County work on the Climate Action Plan and resisting federal policy changes that increase carbon emissions.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Portland has been working on climate change since it became the first city in the United States to adopt a carbon reduction strategy in 1993. Since then, per capita carbon emissions have dropped 40 percent and overall emissions 21 percent below 1990 levels. The far-sighted policies of prioritizing climate change has paid off economically. According to a new analysis by the Portland Development Commission, the region has added 47,0000 clean tech jobs. The expanding urban tree canopy and natural areas, and major public works project like the car-free Tillikum Crossing, boost health and livability and make Portland a global destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By making smart investments now we will help protect our community from the impacts of climate change, reduce our emissions, save money, and create economic opportunity,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson. &ldquo;Those are all huge positives for our county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobby Lee, director of Economic Development at the Portland Development Commission said that Portland has been part of a C40 project with New York, Vancouver, and London to quantify low carbon economies and the results are &ldquo;unequivocally positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The analysis clearly shows there is no either/or choice when it comes to climate policy and the economy, &rsquo;&rsquo; Lee said. &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s climate leadership has created one of its largest sectors and from previous analysis, we know that this sector is rich with middle wage and quality jobs.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler said he is hoping the goals will spark a much broader partnership from utilities to community members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t succeed addressing climate change by government action alone,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;We need our whole community: government, businesses, organizations and households to work together to make a just transition to a 100% renewable future.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>LEAD&reg; pilot project aims to divert low-level drug offenders from jail to services</strong></p>
<p class=""content-left""><strong></strong><br />In an effort to reduce future criminal behavior by people involved in low-level drug offenses and reduce the number of persons of color being arrested and referred to the criminal justice system, County and City leaders are launching an innovative pilot project called LEAD&reg; or Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD&reg;) is a pre-booking diversion program that was developed in Seattle, WA in 2011 and has now been replicated in four other jurisdictions around the country. LEAD&reg; allows police officers to redirect low-level offenders involved in drug activity to intensive case management tailored to the individual's needs instead of jail and prosecution. The goals of this innovative approach are to reduce the harm that a drug offender causes him or herself and the surrounding community, reduce recidivism rates for low-level offenders, reduce the number of low level offenders in jail and decrease the number of people of color prosecuted for low-level drug possession. Participation is voluntary but requires completion of an in-depth assessment within 30-days of arrest for the case not to be filed.</p>
<p>Central City Concern has been contracted to provide intensive case management services for LEAD&reg; participants. The program will focus on high-pedestrian-traffic areas in and near downtown Portland. As the program progresses, stakeholders are committed to a rigorous evaluation of its impact and effectiveness and will evaluate whether LEAD&reg; has resulted in reductions in drug use and recidivism, and is more cost-effective than traditional criminal justice response.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Statement by Mayor Wheeler on Police Response to Recent Protests</strong></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement regarding the police response to recent protests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is an amazing city with a very bright future. It also faces daunting challenges. I was elected to address many of the most difficult issues facing our city: homelessness, housing affordability, crumbling transportation infrastructure, police reform, and racial justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When President Trump took office, some of these challenges were exacerbated, and new ones &ndash; some terrifying &ndash; appeared: a proposed ban on Muslims entering our country; active deportation of our immigrant neighbors; approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline; threats to public education, health coverage, and environmental protection. While not all Portlanders agree with me on these issues, many do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in this context that some Portlanders are protesting, joining others around the nation to ensure that their voices are heard. Portland has a strong history of activism and peaceful protest. But the message is being undermined because of ongoing tensions between protesters and police. We cannot afford for this type of conflict to occur when we have so much other work to do in this city that requires us all to work together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon taking office, I made it clear that I support the Constitutional right to assembly and free expression. I also set some common-sense boundaries that I would ask the police to enforce: no violence, no vandalism, no accessing highways or bridges (for the safety of everyone involved), and no blocking of the regional transit system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding and maintaining an appropriate balance between assembly and order requires constant evaluation and recalibration. Democracy can be messy, that&rsquo;s a fact. But as of late, it&rsquo;s been far too messy here in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week we saw video of protesters in masks surrounding commuters in their vehicles brandishing sticks. That isn&rsquo;t good for democracy. Yesterday we saw images of a woman in her sixties injured during an arrest. That isn&rsquo;t good for democracy either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met with the Police Chief this morning &ndash; after thanking rank-and-file officers for the hard work they do day in and day out &ndash; and I shared my concerns with him. I asked the Chief and his command staff to help create a more positive space for expression and emphasize tactics that deescalate tensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Marshman knows that I support the men and women in our police force. They do tremendous good in our community. The work that they do is dangerous and often thankless. The work requires long hours, quick thinking, and good judgement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inevitably, mistakes will be made. It is my job as Police Commissioner to address them and make changes when necessary. This is one of those times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the coming days the Chief and I will meet with concerned parties and members of the community to discuss how we can best reduce tensions moving forward. It is my expectation that policing in Portland will improve. I ran on a platform of police accountability and I intend to see it through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of protest locally and nationally will be with us for the foreseeable future. Portland can and should be an example of democracy done right. To get there we have some work to do, and we have to work together.&rdquo;</p>

This determination obviously complicates the City&rsquo;s current policy of compelling a statement in the immediate aftermath of an incident. We will continue to evaluate our options.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; The city of Portland has joined Seattle in challenging President Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;sanctuary cities&rdquo; Executive Order (No. 13768, 82 Fed. Reg. 8799).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not merely that our cities&rsquo; values are under attack, it&rsquo;s that these attacks are against the law,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Together, we are standing up for our values and the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the amended complaint filed this week in the Western District of Washington, the cities seek a declaration that they are acting consistently with federal law and that the U.S. Constitution precludes application of the executive order to deny them federal funds to which they are otherwise entitled. The order threatens to strip federal funding from cities that refuse to assist the federal government in immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to have the City of Portland join in Seattle&rsquo;s suit to protect our shared values,&rdquo; City Attorney Pete Holmes said. &ldquo;I look forward to working with the Portland City Attorney, Tracy Reeve, as we work to advance the Rule of Law in challenging times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""Seattle has been a great partner in this effort, and we look forward to continuing this important work together,"" said Tracy Reeve, Portland City Attorney.</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler issued the following statement on recent hate incidents in Portland:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our city, just two weeks removed from a national tragedy, has experienced a number of incidents this week clearly motivated by hate. Threats to the Good in the Hood festival in the heart of Albina, targeting communities of color, particularly black Portlanders. Reports today of racist language directed at a middle school child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unconscionable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The troubling fact is that these incidents are part of an historic and troubling pattern in Portland and across our state. In the days following last year&rsquo;s election, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted more hate incidents in Oregon than other state in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in communication with local school districts, the Governor&rsquo;s office, and are actively working with local, state, and federal law enforcement. We are doing all we can to investigate these recent incidents and protect our residents who are living under threat. If you have any information that could assist investigators, please contact the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These times can be terrifying&hellip; I&rsquo;ve spoken to many people who are scared. We have a tremendous opportunity to come together to ensure that everyone is welcome in our city, and we all live in safety and with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let&rsquo;s continue to stand up for one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OR: Mayor Ted Wheeler issued the following statement in response to today&rsquo;s message from the Portland Police Association:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our city and state have a shared history of racial injustice, from our state's original constitution &ndash; which contained an exclusion law banning black people from living here &ndash; to the hardships faced by those in Vanport before and after the flood, to the disparate outcomes for people of color in our legal system. I have spoken about this shared history at length. I have never called into question the values and beliefs of our rank and file police officers. I have tremendous respect for the hard work they do every day in the community. At a time that calls for a shared vision and unity of purpose regarding the future of the Portland Police Bureau, today&rsquo;s letter from the Portland Police Association is needlessly inflammatory and divisive. We are conducting a national search, fulfilling a commitment I made to the community last year. Anyone applying for the job should be fully aware of our state's history, and prepared to join me in ensuring that this history is just that... in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, May 3rd, Portland City Council enthusiastically adopted an Open Data Ordinance to establish an Open Data Policy and Open Data Program in the City of Portland, culminating an effort that began with the passage of Resolution No. 36735 in 2009 declaring Portland&rsquo;s commitment to Open Data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2009, Portland was the very first jurisdiction to declare its commitment to Open Data,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Portland continues to be on the cutting edge, now taking this important next step to set up policies to implement an Open Data Program in the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Establishing an Open Data Policy and Program and a system of data governance in the City of Portland will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase transparency and improve public trust.</li>
<li>Build civic participation and engagement.</li>
<li>Improve access to data to inform and improve decision-making.</li>
<li>Reduce staff time devoted to responding to requests for City data.</li>
<li>Grow the likelihood of data-driven innovations in the private sector that increase the social and commercial value of City assets and improve the delivery of City services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Open Data Policy and Program are fundamental to the City of Portland&rsquo;s Smart Cities efforts. Shared, standardized systems for collecting, managing, analyzing and distributing data are foundational requirements to meet Portland&rsquo;s goals to use data to inform decisions, to design and evaluate policies and programs and to partner with the private sector to meet City goals around livability, affordability, safety, sustainability and equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This program will bring a powerful tool to our residents, local businesses and mission-driven organizations,&ldquo; remarked Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;Open Data is about fostering transparency and efficiency in government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advancing an Open Data policy for the City of Portland has been part of the City&rsquo;s partnership with <a href=""https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"">Bloomberg Philanthropies&rsquo; What Works Cities (WWC) initiative</a>, which helps cities enhance their use of data and evidence to improve residents&rsquo; lives. Portland&rsquo;s selection to the initiative was announced in September of 2016. The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability (BPS) has been leading the Open Data effort in partnership with the City Budget Office (CBO). BPS and CBO worked with technical experts from two of WWC&rsquo;s partners, <a href=""https://govex.jhu.edu/"">the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University</a> and the <a href=""https://sunlightfoundation.com/"">Sunlight Foundation</a>, to develop the Open Data Ordinance.</p>
<p>By adopting the Open Data Ordinance, City Council:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established a general Open Data policy: The City will be committed to the publication, accessibility and equitable and widespread sharing of data collected and generated by all City bureaus and by private sector companies, non-profit organizations, academic universities and other parties working on behalf of the City. The City will strive to make data open by default.</li>
<li>Created an Open Data Program to implement the policy.</li>
<li>Established a Data Governance team, which will include representatives from multiple bureaus, to determine the overall direction of the Open Data Program, develop more specific data-sharing policies, and to engage external stakeholders in program design and implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability is tasked with the initial implementation of the program, in partnership with the Mayor&rsquo;s Office, the City Budget Office, the Bureau of Technology Services and other City bureaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think what is really before us here today is another way to advance the core values of our City around access and transparency, empowering the public, and ultimately being accountable,&rdquo; commented Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;And when we get those right, there is greater public trust in our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler added, &ldquo;This is an essential first step to democratizing our data.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/639535

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Announces Community Policing Pilot</strong><br /><em>Officers will walk and bike neighborhoods to build community trust and promote livability</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash;Mayor Ted Wheeler today announced an increase in walking and biking beats for officers to build positive relationships and address public safety issues.</p>
<p>Informed by a robust dialogue and data from individuals, neighborhood associations, businesses, and community advocates, the identified areas for the pilot are the Springwater Corridor, Laurelhurst Park, Oldtown/Chinatown, North Park Blocks, Ankeny Alley, and the Hawthorne Business District.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am committed to creating a 21st Century police force and to improving livability in Portland,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;This program moves us forward in achieving both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot builds on President Obama&rsquo;s lauded Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which recommends &ldquo;assigning officers to geographic areas on a consistent basis so that through the continuity of assignment they have the opportunity to know the members of the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, this approach could align efforts with the innovative Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program. LEAD allows police officers to redirect low-level offenders involved in drug activity to intensive case management tailored to the individual's needs instead of jail and prosecution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for officers to directly engage with people in the community and get to know the neighborhoods and work together,&rdquo; said Chief Mike Marshman.</p>
<p>Patrol officer walking and biking beats will continue through the summer. The strategy will undergo continuous evaluation to determine next steps.</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler today announced that he has selected Danielle Outlaw to become the next Chief of the Portland Police Bureau. Outlaw is a 19-year veteran of the Oakland Police Department, where she served as a Deputy Chief since 2013. Outlaw will be formally introduced at a press conference on Thursday, August 10. (<a href=""/wheeler/article/650321"">Her bio can be found here.</a>)</p>
<p>During the selection process, Mayor Wheeler emphasized the qualities he wants in a police chief, based upon the principles of President Obama&rsquo;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The Mayor selected Outlaw based on her ability to provide leadership and supervision to over 950 sworn and 270 non-sworn employees, to work effectively with diverse communities, and to lead an organization committed to community policing, transparency and accountability. Wheeler and Outlaw have a shared dedication to improving relationships with Portland&rsquo;s communities of color, increasing diversity and embracing equity.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I have concrete goals for the Portland Police Bureau, all of them challenging to achieve. I need a partner. I need a leader. More than that, I need someone with a passion for this work who will be in it for the long haul,&rdquo; said Wheeler. &ldquo;Danielle Outlaw is that person.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Outlaw worked for the Oakland Police Department since 1997, beginning her career as an Oakland Police Explorer while she was a student at Holy Names High School. She rose through the ranks, with assignments including Patrol, Community Services, the Office of Chief of Police, the Criminal Investigation Division, Public Information, Internal Affairs and the Office of Inspector General, and the Bureau of Risk Management.</p>
<p>Outlaw was the 2nd female Deputy Chief in the history of the Oakland Police Department and the 1st this century. She is also the 1st woman in the history of the Department to lead The Bureau of Field Operations Two, which encompasses East Oakland.</p>
<p>Outlaw obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of San Francisco and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University. She is a graduate of the Police Executive Research Forum Senior Management Institute for Police and the Major Cities Chiefs&rsquo; Association Police Executive Leadership Institute. Outlaw is a member of the National Organization for Black Law Enforcement Executives (N.O.B.L.E.).</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My life&rsquo;s passion is policing. I want to make a positive difference in the lives of my fellow officers and the residents of the community,&rdquo; said Outlaw. &ldquo;Portland is an amazing City. I am humbled by the tremendous opportunity in front of me, and am ready to get to get to work.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The Mayor undertook a recruitment and selection process that included public input. That process included an online survey asking Portland residents the qualities and characteristics in the next police chief. The Mayor held invited community focus groups to help develop the job description. The City formed interview panels consisting of community stakeholders to forward their recommendations to the mayor.</p>
<p>Outlaw will step into a role previously held by Mike Marshman. During his tenure as Chief, Marshman jump-started recruitment efforts, attracting a highly-qualified, diverse set of recruits to fill a shortage in the ranks of officers. Morale, which had earlier dipped to crisis levels, improved greatly under Marshman.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Mike Marshman made tremendous strides in key areas during his time as Chief,&rdquo; said Wheeler. &ldquo;I enjoyed a positive working relationship with him, and have the highest respect for him as a leader and as a person. He is a good man.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Wheeler has set an intended start date for Outlaw of no later than Monday, October, 2. The offer of employment is contingent upon the successful completion of a background check conducted by the Oregon State Police. The background check is expected to take four to six weeks. Outlaw has stated her intention to live within Portland city limits.</p>
<p>The mission of the Portland Police Bureau is to work with the community to create and maintain safe neighborhoods. The Bureau&rsquo;s mission is to reduce crime and the fear of crime by working with all citizens to preserve life, maintain human rights, protect property and promote individual responsibility and community commitment.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br />July 21, 2017<br />Contact: Michael Cox, 503-823-6593</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Accountability is Job One: Elimination of 48-Hour Rule Must Stand</strong><br /><em>Mayor Ted Wheeler wants Court to OK compelled interviews in police use of deadly force investigations</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Today Mayor Ted Wheeler will file an ordinance to be brought in front of City Council to preserve the elimination of the &ldquo;48-Hour Rule.&rdquo; The ordinance details investigative procedures to be used in an employment investigation of an officer involved in the use of deadly force. Those procedures include a compelled interview of the involved officer within 48 hours of the incident, as well as assurances that the employment investigation can be effectively walled off from the criminal investigation. Finally, the ordinance asks for Court review to ensure investigations are properly conducted under the Oregon Constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I oppose the 48-Hour Rule. Officers who wrongly use deadly force should no longer wear a badge,&rdquo; said Wheeler. &ldquo;The previous Council paid a steep price to eliminate the rule and I want it gone forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the fight to ensure thorough and timely employment investigations of officers who used deadly force involves a March memo from Multnomah County District Attorney, laying out his legal reasoning that an Oregon Supreme Court Decision, State v. Soriano (1982), prevents compelled interviews. The DA&rsquo;s interpretation was later backed by an Oregon Department of Justice memo, which acknowledged grey areas in the law remain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The DA&rsquo;s interpretation of the law is the best we have at this time, but I am not convinced a case from 1982, which did not deal with the question of concurrent employment and criminal investigations, should be the final word on issues critical to police accountability and public trust today,&rdquo; said Wheeler.</p>
<p>Employment investigations are a powerful tool to ensure bad actors are held to account. Criminal prosecutions of officers involved in the use of deadly force are rare, and convictions even more so. However, the City has a responsibility to be mindful of taking any action or implementing any policy which might interfere with the Multnomah County DA&rsquo;s ability to hold a police officer responsible for criminal behavior.</p>
<p><a href=""/wheeler/article/647917"">The ordinance</a> (with <a href=""/wheeler/article/647921"">Exhibit A</a>. <a href=""/wheeler/article/647923"">Exhibit B</a>, and <a href=""/wheeler/article/647925"">Exhibit C</a>) will come before City Council on August 3. If approved, it will take effect upon entry of a final judgment and conclusion of subsequent appeals, if any, by Oregon courts. Mayor Wheeler continues to actively pursue additional options to ensure interviews are conducted within 48 hours.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Council Approves Mayor&rsquo;s Appointment to Planning and Sustainability Commission</strong><br /><em>Benvenuto (Ben) Bortolazzo becomes newest of the 11-member commission</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; On August 3, 2017, City Council approved Mayor Ted Wheeler&rsquo;s nominee to the Planning and Sustainability Commission (PSC), Ben Bortolazzo. He fills the remaining open position on the PSC. The PSC had its first meeting with the newest member August 22.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bortolazzo brings quality design and community engagement experience to the PSC,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to have him as our next appointment to the PSC and look forward to his contributions to this advisory body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benvenuto currently leads the Otak Portland Planning and Design team, a highly skilled multi-disciplinary design team engaged in shaping successful communities. He holds a Master of Architecture degree with a certificate in Urban Design from the University of Washington, as well as an Architecture Diploma from IUAV in Venice, Italy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born in Italy,&rdquo; Bortolazzo told Council. &ldquo;Influenced by some of the world&rsquo;s famous public spaces, I studied architecture and urban design. When my wife and I moved here from Italy about 12 years ago, we deliberately chose to live in Portland because of its livability, walkability and great public realm. I am passionate about urban form and urban design that contributes to creating a sense of place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine Schultz, PSC Chair and an architect, said, &ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s reputation for thoughtful, responsive, exciting work is so solid in our community. I&rsquo;m excited to have a design professional of his caliber join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PSC is a group of 11 volunteers with expertise in a range of areas. They spend many hours each month reviewing plans and policies that affect land use and all sectors of the community, hearing from the public, and making recommendations to City Council. Unlike many other cities where the Planning Commission is made up of people primarily from the development community, Portland&rsquo;s Planning and Sustainability Commission embraces a much broader approach. Each PSC member brings a set of knowledge, talents and experiences, including architecture, transportation, housing, the environment, economic development and the law.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>City, Central City Concern, Neighborhood Coalition, and Businesses Pilot Program to Remove Trash</strong><br /><em>Central City Concern&rsquo;s Clean Start PDX program helps keep neighborhoods clean</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler, along with the Central Eastside Industrial Council (CEIC) and Central City Concern (CCC), today announced a pilot to increase capacity to remove trash and debris in Portland neighborhoods. CCC has added a fourth crew to its successful CCC Clean Start PDX program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland residents can access these services through the City of Portland&rsquo;s One Point of Contact webpage, or PDX Reporter,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;This is a great opportunity to provide employment and improve livability in our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CCC Clean Start PDX represents a collaboration between the Central Eastside Industrial Council (CEIC), and Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods (NECN), and the City of Portland. &ldquo;This is a very constructive and positive way to address litter in our neighborhoods,&rdquo; says Adam Lyons, NECN executive director. &ldquo;We appreciate the partnerships in this innovative project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""The CEIC is excited to be a part of this pilot project,&rdquo; said Juliana Lukasik, CEIC executive director. &ldquo;We are currently looking for funding options to implement a similar program in the rest of the Central Eastside District. We are currently in a cycle of unprecedented growth and with the growth comes growing pains. Finding sustainable solutions to issues around safety, graffiti abatement and district cleaning are extremely important for the future. But addressing those issues right now is critical. Central City Concern&rsquo;s nationally recognized programming is a perfect fit now and in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each crew consists of a truck and two workers, most of whom have been homeless at some point in their past. The crew responds to requests to clean up litter, remove graffiti and work with homeless people living outdoors to help them keep their area clean. They develop relationships with homeless people in camps and offer to provide trash bags and regular clean-up schedules.</p>
<p>The program provides a six-month training program for formerly homeless people re-entering the workforce. During their six-month work experience, CCC Clean Start and Clean &amp; Safe trainees receive one-on-one assistance in finding a permanent, full-time job through CCC&rsquo;s Employment Access Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a way for people who have previously experienced homelessness to gain job skills and employment,&rdquo; said Jay McIntyre, CCC&rsquo;s Clean Start program manager.</p>
<p>The Downtown Clean &amp; Safe District contracts with Central City Concern to clean the 213-block business improvement district in central downtown and along the bus mall. CCC Clean Start also operates a temporary storage locker near the west end of the Steel Bridge where people who have no place to call home can put their belongings for a few hours while they work or seek employment.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Right 2 Dream Too Signs Good Neighbor Agreement with Lloyd District</strong><br /><em>Public safety, communications, and celebration plans underway</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Right 2 Dream Too (R2DToo) has signed a Good Neighbor Agreement (GNA) with Lloyd District organizations and the City of Portland after a collaborative, three-month discussion. Partner organizations include the Lloyd District Community Association, Rip City Management, the Lloyd Enhanced Service District, and the City of Portland.</p>
<p>In May, R2DToo moved to its current site, located between the Rose Quarter and the Willamette River. An agreement with the City allows R2DToo to stay on the site for up to two years.</p>
<p>From the start, the rest area&rsquo;s Lloyd District neighbors came to the table with arms outstretched to R2DToo, helping with the logistics of their move from Old Town/Chinatown, delivering food to volunteers, and strategizing about a public safety and communications plan. Now, the parties are jointly working on a fundraiser and celebration welcoming R2DToo to the District, on a date to be announced later this fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a resident of the Lloyd, I am happy to have Right 2 Dream Too as part of my community,&rdquo; said Keith Jones from the Lloyd District Community Association. &ldquo;In the short time they have been here, they have become an active and positive contributor to our neighborhood. I also am very pleased with the way that the community as a whole has pulled together to welcome and support R2DToo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah Chandler, R2DToo Board Chair and Member, says she&rsquo;s been overwhelmed by the amount of support from the community. &ldquo;Our Lloyd District neighbors have given us the opportunity to explain what we do and how our model is different, and they&rsquo;ve been open to figuring out how we can fit into the community and play a helping role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Good Neighbor Agreement process has been a heartwarming and reassuring example of community building between housed and unhoused individuals,&rdquo; said Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who has worked with R2DToo and City agencies since 2013 to help the group find a new home after the lease expired on its previous Old Town/Chinatown location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homelessness is a community-wide challenge, and in the case of supporting the success of R2DToo, this has truly been a community effort,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Commissioner Fritz has dedicated years to ensuring R2DToo continues to thrive, and I thank her, our neighborhood partners, and local businesses for their participation in this Good Neighbor Agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>R2DToo is a nonprofit organization (501(c)(3) charitable organization) operating a rest area which provides refuge and a safe place to rest or sleep undisturbed for Portland's unhoused community members who cannot access affordable housing or shelter. The Eastside location was identified and its set-up managed by the staff of Mayor Ted Wheeler, and the GNA process was facilitated by Judith Mowry from the City&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights.</p>
<p>Other partnering organizations include Lloyd EcoDistrict, the Portland Police Bureau, the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods and the Office of Neighborhood Involvement Crime Prevention program.</p>

<p><strong>Hill Block Project Working Group Announces Open House and Information Session on February 20</strong></p>
<p><em>Group will oversee process that ensures a transparent, community-serving project</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; A group of community representatives tasked with leading the visioning and development process for <a href=""https://prosperportland.us/portfolio-items/the-hill-block-n-russell-and-williams-collaboration/"">the Hill Block project</a> at North Russell Street and North Williams Avenue will hold an open house and information session on Tuesday, February 20, from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. at New Song Community Church, to collect individual feedback from community members regarding theirs hopes, concerns, and aspirations for the property.</p>
<p>The February event will mark the transition of project stewardship from institutional partners to the Hill Block Project Working Group and introduce the Project Working Group to the community.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2017, Prosper Portland, the Office of City of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, and Legacy Health announced a collaborative project to develop the Hill Block property, a vacant 1.7 acre block currently owned by Legacy Health.&nbsp; The property is located within an area that Prosper Portland and the City of Portland condemned in the early 1970s under urban renewal for an expansion of the hospital campus, displacing 171 families, 74 percent of which were African American. The focus of the new development is to honor Portland&rsquo;s African-American community, support community housing and economic needs, and further Legacy Health&rsquo;s mission of promoting health and wellness for children and families.</p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re grateful to our partners at Legacy Health and Prosper Portland, and especially appreciative of the many community organizations that nominated representatives to serve on the Project Working Group. We&rsquo;re looking forward to moving ahead in a positive way with a group that could become a model for future city of Portland outreach efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prosper Portland Executive Director Kimberly Branam said, &ldquo;With the launch of the Project Working Group, we&rsquo;ve embarked on a strong community-based process that will define and expand decision-making beyond institutional partners. This is a historic opportunity to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and learn from diverse voices, expertise and vision to deliver a project that honors the African American community and fosters opportunity for wealth creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Brown, M.D., president and CEO of Legacy Health, said, &ldquo;This development will benefit the community by helping to expand Legacy Emanuel&rsquo;s mission of healing in this community. In looking ahead at Legacy&rsquo;s needs and the community&rsquo;s needs, as well as looking at what opportunities Prosper Portland and the City of Portland can offer, I am exceptionally pleased that we can be a part of what I believe will be a historic partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nominations to the Project Working Group involved outreach to more than 20 organizations and community groups within or with a strong connection to the North/Northeast community. Two seats on the Project Working Group were reserved for community-at-large members who could submit their own statements of interest. In determining the final roster, the Nominating Committee, composed of community representatives, focused on generational diversity and a broad set of perspectives and skills. A list of the Project Working Group members and background on the project are available <a href=""https://prosperportland.us/portfolio-items/the-hill-block-n-russell-and-williams-collaboration/"">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Project Working Group will oversee a year-long visioning and development process that ensures a transparent, community-serving project; oversee the selection of the development team; and communicate about its work to the organizations and stakeholders it represents as well as the community at large.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/672087

<p>Portland, OR&ndash;The Office of Mayor Wheeler will host its monthly public safety forum on June 27 from 6:30-8:30 pm at 1900 SW 4th Avenue Room 2500B, on the topic of how police interact with vulnerable populations, including the houseless and those struggling with mental health and addiction.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting will include two panels, featuring both service providers and public safety officials across jurisdictions who interact with vulnerable populations, in order to examine addiction and mental health from a public safety lens. The forum will discuss the importance of a public safety approach that is both accountable and compassionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mayor&rsquo;s Office is proud to spearhead a program &ndash; the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP) &ndash; to develop recommendations for how the Portland Police Bureau can better engage the community in its development of policies that directly affect Portlanders, with a specific focus on racial justice, constitutional policing and mental health issues. Part of PCCEP&rsquo;s role is to facilitate conversations with Portlanders about public safety and police accountability. The Mayor&rsquo;s office will host interim community forums until the PCCEP is established and members are seated. These interim meetings are held the last Wednesday of every month.</p>

<p><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler, City Officials and Intel, AT&amp;T, Current by GE, and PGE celebrate Traffic Safety Sensor Project</strong></p>
<p><em>200 Safety Sensors are being installed on 122nd, Hawthorne and Division as part of first major milestone in Portland&rsquo;s </em><a href=""https://www.smartcitypdx.com/""><em>Smart City PDX</em></a><em> initiative.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland, OR -- Mayor Ted Wheeler joined officials from the Portland Bureau of Transportation and representatives from Intel, AT&amp;T, Current by GE and Portland General Electric today to celebrate the Traffic Sensor Safety Project, the first major milestone for<a href=""https://www.smartcitypdx.com/""> Smart City PDX</a>, the City of Portland&rsquo;s effort to use data and technology to improve people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than starting with a technology and looking for reasons to use it, Smart City PDX is structured to first identify inequities and disparities in the city and then strategically apply data and technology to address those challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 20, 2018, Portland City Council will vote on the <strong>Smart City PDX Priorities Framework</strong>, a structured process for evaluating new technologies, uses of information, and related partnerships to ensure they provide tangible benefits to the people of Portland. As the first project under the Smart City PDX banner, the Traffic Safety Sensor Project helped to inform the development of the Priorities Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Traffic Sensor Safety Project, the City is installing 200 Current by GE <a href=""https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/internet-of-things/market-ready-solutions/ge-cityiq.html"">CityIQ</a>&trade; sensors, powered by Intel&reg; IoT technology, on SE Division, 122nd and SE Hawthorne, three of Portland&rsquo;s deadliest streets. The sensors will provide around-the-clock counts of 0vehicles and pedestrians as well as information about vehicle speeds. With this new data, city traffic engineers can improve street safety design and support Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero goal of making the streets safe for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is leading the country in this important data effort,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;We are at the forefront of using advanced technology to make our cities safer for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers, helping people more easily get around, save time and reduce the possibility of crashes. This pilot is a significant step in acquiring and utilizing data to make critical decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Designing safe streets starts with good data,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Until now, collecting this data was time and volunteer intensive. Now with these smart sensors, we can get real-time data about how Portlanders are using our streets. As a result, our traffic engineers will be smarter and Portlanders will be safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to improved data insights, the CityIQ open platform is designed to handle future growth using the exact same street lighting infrastructure, so Portland can continue adapting and developing new applications that meet the specific needs of the city and its residents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is a great example of how every city is able to tailor their solution to meet specific challenges and opportunities,&rdquo; said Austin Ashe, Smart Cities General Manager for Current by GE. &ldquo;For example, we will be working with Portland to extract bicycle data to better understand the bicycle traffic volume and cyclists&rsquo; interactions with vehicle and pedestrian traffic to improve safety for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a leader in IoT and Smart Cities, we know the transformational benefit that technology can have on cities,&rdquo; said Michael Zeto, VP of AT&amp;T IoT and General Manager of Smart Cities. &ldquo;Portland is at the forefront of unlocking these possibilities and we expect our AT&amp;T Digital Infrastructure to have a strong impact on improving safety and efficiency in the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The safety project is part of Smart City PDX, the City of Portland&rsquo;s urban data and technology strategy. A finalist in the 2016 Smart City Challenge sponsored by the United States Department of Transportation, Portland has continued to expand its overall effort to use data and technology to increase safety, reduce inequities and improve the quality of life for Portlanders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart collaborations between city officials, corporations and software developers are creating infrastructures that empower citizens while making our cities more resilient and responsive. &nbsp;The City of Portland deployment of smart traffic sensors is a great example of this and will improve the safety and quality of life for its citizens,&rdquo; said Jonathan Ballon, vice president, Internet of Things Group at Intel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Together, Intel, Current by GE, Portland General Electric (PGE) and AT&amp;T provide an innovative smart lighting solution to enhance Portland&rsquo;s downtown infrastructure, optimize traffic patterns, and increase safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sensor project, which installed new mast arms and the sensors on street light poles on the three corridors, <a href=""/transportation/76739"">costs $1,012,000</a>. It was funded with general transportation revenue, system development charges and contributions by the project&rsquo;s private sector collaborators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PGE is thrilled to be working with the city on a number of smart city initiatives,&rdquo; said Larry Bekkedahl, vice president of transmission and distribution, PGE. &ldquo;By partnering and innovating together, we can create a more purposeful, informed, and sustainable way of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data gathered from the sensors will be collected in the Portland Urban Data Lake (PUDL). Part of the overall Smart City PDX initiative, PUDL will collect, store, combine, and analyze data from a variety of sources including the Traffic Safety Sensor Pilot. The goal of PUDL is to provide a foundation for data-driven decision making, helping the City of Portland to harness the power of data to improve City services.</p>

<p><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>June 11, 2018</p>
<p>Contact: Sophia June, 503-823-8582</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>TriMet, City of Portland and School Districts Will Provide Free Transit Passes for Low-Income Students in Portland Public, David Douglas and Parkrose High Schools</strong></p>
<p><em>TriMet and the City of Portland have long assisted low-income students in accessing education and other opportunities.</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR&mdash;High school students in three major Portland school districts can qualify to continue to receive a free TriMet student pass during the 2018-19 school year, as part of an agreement between TriMet, the City of Portland, Portland Public Schools (PPS), and the Parkrose and David Douglas school districts. TriMet and PPS are continuing to fund student passes for PPS high schools where no yellow bus service is provided. In the David Douglas and Parkrose districts, the City is allowing the districts to carry over unutilized funds to help continue paying for student transit passes for low-income students during the 2018-19 school year, and TriMet has agreed to provide a one-third match for these funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This agreement means that for the coming year these students will have greater access to jobs, training opportunities, classes at Portland Community or Mt. Hood Community colleges, libraries and other destinations that support their education,&rdquo; said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler.</p>
<p>TriMet and the City of Portland have long assisted low-income students in accessing education and other opportunities in the community. This is ever more important due to gentrification and demographic changes in the David Douglas and Parkrose districts, where high schools now have substantially higher proportions of disadvantaged students than the PPS district. Public transit is often critical for these students to meet their non-school transportation needs.</p>
<p>TriMet has an established policy to provide one-third of the funding for a high school student transit pass in any school district in its service district, with the remainder of the funds contributed by the jurisdiction and/or school district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy to partner with the City of Portland as well as the Portland Public, David Douglas and Parkrose districts,&rdquo; said TriMet General Manager Doug Kelsey. &ldquo;This partnership will give students whose financial situation puts them at a disadvantage to their peers access to transit &ndash; and access to opportunity &ndash; for the upcoming school year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the City of Portland and TriMet will convene a working group to explore long-term strategies for providing transit passes to low-income students in the Portland-area. Those strategies could include using funding from a new employee payroll tax established by the Keep Oregon Moving Law (HB2017) passed by the State Legislature and signed into law by Oregon Governor Kate Brown last summer. It requires one percent of the revenue from the tax to go toward high school student transportation. The working group may also consider seeking state financial support for student transit programs and identifying other funding opportunities at the regional or state level.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/687327
Press Releases,686089,City of Portland and Downtown Clean & Safe partner to bring new garbage cans to downtown Portland this summer,1,,2018-05-30 21:52:06 UTC,2018-05-30 21:23:00 UTC,A,"New design will improve livability, provide more funding for critical services","<p><strong>Portland, Ore. &ndash;</strong> Today, the city of Portland, in partnership with Downtown Clean &amp; Safe and the Portland Business Alliance, voted to approve Clean &amp; Safe&rsquo;s purchase of 100 garbage can units to be manufactured and deployed to downtown streets by mid-summer 2018. Clean &amp; Safe&rsquo;s board of directors voted to support the city&rsquo;s new high-capacity garbage cans by funding the entire rollout of the program within the downtown business improvement district, with $200,000 designated in this fiscal year and an additional $200,000 in the 2018-19 fiscal year to convert all remaining cement round cans with the new design.</p>
<p>This partnership allows the city to use its funds in other areas of the city that need expanded garbage disposal capacity. The new high-volume garbage cans include strong locking mechanisms that prevent damage to the cans and a side shelf for recyclable bottles. Additionally, the new downtown garbage cans will feature bold graphic designs from local artist, Dan Stiles, bringing more fun and energy to the streetscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Clean &amp; Safe, we understand how important these partnerships are to truly make a difference in our city,&rdquo; said Lynnae Berg, executive director of Downtown Clean &amp; Safe and vice president of downtown services at the Portland Business Alliance. &ldquo;This new style of garbage can will expand capacity and help ensure that downtown Portland is a clean, safe and attractive place for people to work, shop, visit and live.&rdquo;</p>

Press Releases,683904,Mayor Wheeler’s Message on the Proposed Budget,1,,2018-05-11 02:23:05 UTC,2018-05-11 02:18:00 UTC,A,"May 10th, 2018","<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">The proposed budget invests record funding for homeless services, includes strategies and resources to increase community-centered policing, focuses on support for small businesses, and moves the city budget toward long-term fiscal sustainability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My proposed budget makes significant investments to address four core objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embracing fiscal responsibility both now and over the long-term</li>
<li>Addressing housing affordability and homelessness</li>
<li>Strengthening public safety and police accountability</li>
<li>Enhancing economic prosperity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The proposed budget increases the Business License Tax rate, from the current 2.2% to 2.6%, while increasing the Owner&rsquo;s Compensation Deduction from $103,000 to $125,000, to give small business owners some additional relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would result in an estimated $15.3 million in additional revenues this year to stabilize the budget for homeless services, invest more in moving people out of shelters and into housing, fund programs in the Police Bureau that support community-centered policing, add resources to trash and graffiti cleanup, and to provide additional small business support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address <strong>HOMELESSNESS</strong>, my budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A record $31.2 million for the Joint Office, a 10.1% increase compared with last year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significantly increases resources for housing placement, particularly those who are transitioning from shelter by an additional $3 million.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Converts $4 million in one-time dollars to ongoing support for year-round shelter, housing placement, and intensive street engagement. This will provide ongoing stability on the budget allocated toward the Joint Office of Homeless Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizes and aligns funds for supportive housing so that we can continue to make good on our efforts to provide an additional 2,000 units of supportive housing over the next 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address <strong>HOUSING</strong>, my budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invests in more than 700 newly affordable units currently under construction and slated to open in 2018, and an additional 1,322 units that are beginning construction and will be opening their doors in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allocates $2,040,521 to the Office of Rental Services, which was formed to inform renters and landlords of their rights and responsibilities, to mediate disputes between parties, and to manage the rental relocation assistance program. This includes $200,000 to create a Rental Registration System, which will provide quality data on the rental market, including rent increases, evictions, security deposits and more. That data is essential to policymakers as we work to address the current housing affordability crisis. In addition, the budget includes $175,000 in one-time General Fund resources to manage the coordination of the development and implementation of the Rental Registration System across City bureaus for the Office of Rental Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Increases the amount of funding available for Citywide home repair by $294,393, prioritizing services for households in East Portland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Includes two new staff to support implementation of the Affordable Housing Bond, funded by allowable bond administrative funding. The Proposed Budget also realigns $352,500 in permanent supportive housing funding from the Joint Office of Homeless Services&rsquo; budget to the Portland Housing Bureau in order to pair housing services with affordable units developed through the bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address <strong>POLICING</strong>, my budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorizes 52 additional sworn officers to help the bureau curb increasing response time for 911 calls, reduce the bureau&rsquo;s reliance on overtime, reduce officer fatigue, and pivot toward a community policing model over the next several years. That means more time spent meeting with residents, business owners, attending community meetings, and building trust with the residents of Portland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enhances the Behavioral Health Unit to respond to individuals experiencing mental health issues. The officers and mental health professionals on the Behavioral Health Response Teams work proactively with individuals who have mental health issues and are identified as having multiple or high-risk contacts with police. The goal of intervention is to reduce the individual&rsquo;s contacts with the Portland Police Bureau and the criminal justice system by coordinating their connection with the healthcare system. We&rsquo;re going to increase the number of BHU teams from three to five, providing additional case management and follow up contacts. We think this ask can increase the number of clients served by 50% &hellip; that&rsquo;s an additional 250 clients over last year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Restores ongoing funding to the Service Coordination Team. The SCT is a program that offers treatment and housing to repeat and frequent drug and property crime offenders. The SCT program has produced measurable positive results around reduced recidivism (reduced 82% for program graduates) and several evaluations from PSU have shown that the program results in significant cost-savings across the justice system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adds 3 analyst positions to expand the internal audit staff in the Professional Standards Division. Additional staff capacity will allow for follow-up support on use-of-force audits, as well as expand the internal audit function to include other bureau policies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adds 4 dedicated officer positions in the Training Division responsible for Ethics and Procedural Justice, Leadership Development, Basic Patrol Procedures, and Advanced Training.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adds two staff to the Records Division to decrease the amount of time required to fulfill public records requests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Funds positions to assist with the development of the PCCEP program in accordance with the Department of Justice settlement amendments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Directs the Police Bureau and the Office of Management &amp; Finance to ensure that the Community Service Officer program is implemented by January 1st, 2019.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides ongoing funds for a Complaints Investigator position for Independent Police Review. The position will help the Auditor&rsquo;s Office meet its obligations under the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice regarding turnaround times for investigations of complaints of police misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To address <strong>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY</strong>, my budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases support for Small Business Growth Program &amp; Small Business Technical Assistance to help 200 businesses reach growth and wealth creation outcomes, and support 400 business owners on their path to become strong and stable. Most Inclusive Business Resource Network business owners are from underrepresented communities such as people of color, low-income residents and women.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address <strong>FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY</strong>, my budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invests in more resources and technology to collect taxes that are already owed, including the business license tax. These investments should more than pay for themselves with increased revenue collections.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Requires every General Fund bureau to identify efficiencies equaling 1% of their budgets over the next 12 months through realignments, smart use of technology, reduction of overhead, or other means that do not impact front line service delivery to the public. Next year, the base budgets of each bureau will account for these savings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Converts $4.0 million of one-time dollars spent on homeless services into ongoing funds, which will help us move toward a more sustainable Joint Office.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Includes $12.3 million in one-time General Fund resources to address critical infrastructure needs in Transportation, Parks, and Fire. In addition, my Parks budget includes $625,000 in ongoing resources to increase the bureau&rsquo;s major maintenance funding and directs the bureau to keep requesting major maintenance funding every year until they have enough to maintain our beautiful parks system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Includes strategies that will reduce our dependence on expensive overtime staffing in the Police Bureau.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are now almost into our tenth year of economic expansion, and the majority of Portland&rsquo;s economic indicators are stronger than they&rsquo;ve ever been. Incomes are rising. Unemployment is near an all-time low. The region continues to attract a highly skilled workforce and add new businesses.</p>
<p>However, recent years of economic growth and revenue expansion have made it too easy for Portland government to lose its focus when it comes to fiscal discipline.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">I have a responsibility to the people I represent, and those who come after me, to recognize that our costs are growing much faster than our revenues, our resources are finite, and our needs are substantial. My proposed budget addresses this misalignment head-on, with several initiatives focused on Portland&rsquo;s long-term fiscal sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">My proposed budget focuses our resources on the things that make a real difference in the lives of Portlanders. It is our responsibility address homelessness compassionately and effectively, to invest in affordable housing units, to work towards a community-centered policing model and to ensure economic growth and fiscal discipline for long-term success.</span></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/683904

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My budget increases funding to prevent homelessness, provide shelter for those living outside in the elements, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; guide people into permanent housing while connecting them to the services they need to get off and stay off the streets,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full budget details can be found by following the links at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>The Mayor&rsquo;s proposed budget includes an increase in the Business License Tax rate, from the current 2.2% to 2.6%, while increasing the Owner&rsquo;s Compensation Deduction from $103,000 to $125,000, to give small business owners some additional relief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about how homelessness is a community-wide challenge, and how it&rsquo;s going to take solutions from all corners to address this challenge effectively. So, I was grateful when the Portland Business Alliance came to me to say they wanted to step up in a big way in this year&rsquo;s budget,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;We understand that together we can do more to help people experiencing homelessness find the shelter and services they need to get off the street, and that the ultimate goal is to move people out of shelters and into housing. We&rsquo;re partnering together to achieve these goals.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa content-center"">City Request for PCCEP Facilitator</h2>
<p class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"">The City has posted an RFP (Request for Proposals) to hire a Facilitator to facilitate the establishment and development of the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP), a committee of community members charged with assessing the City of Portland&rsquo;s implementation of a Settlement Agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ). This RFP replaces the RFP for an Organizational Development Consultant. The original RFP was cancelled and redrafted utilizing community feedback in order to solicit a larger application pool by reducing barriers to small businesses. The new proposal seeks a qualified person or people with demonstrated experience in group development and facilitation, transformational conflict resolution, providing community groups with the skills needed to navigate challenging and controversial subject matter, and experience working with the mental health community to facilitate the establishment and development of the PCCEP. The role of the Facilitator will be to a) support the City in establishing the PCCEP and b) support the PCCEP so that is can: solidify as a group, determine its approach to the work, and create policies and procedures that support its long-term success. The successful Proposer will have familiarity with the history of community oversight of the Settlement Agreement in Portland, an understanding of Portland&rsquo;s communities and their histories with the police and with trauma, and have a passion for helping diverse groups of people discuss challenging subject manager in the service of positive change.</p>
<p class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"">The Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP) was developed as part of amendments made to the Settlement Agreement between the United States and the City of Portland, and seeks to continue and improve upon the work of the Community Oversight and Advisory Board (COAB), which was initially established through the Settlement Agreement. PCCEP will consist of Portland community members who will assess the City of Portland's implementation of the Settlement Agreement, and work with the Mayor/Police Commissioner, the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), and the Portland community to achieve the desired outcomes of equitable policing and meaningful engagement and trust in the PPB. The agreement calls for reforms to PPB policies and training, particularly as they relate to interactions with people who have or are perceived to be in mental health crisis. The Consultant will, among other things, support the PCCEP by helping the City to establish an equitable process for recruiting and appointing PCCEP members, create a robust onboarding and training process for PCCEP members, and support the PCCEP in setting a direction and vision for their work, as well as support them in creating a Work Plan with a focus on community outreach, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"">The City encourages Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, Minority Owned Business Enterprises, Women Owned Business Enterprises, and Emerging Small Businesses (D/M/W/ESBs) to apply in order to promote their economic growth and to provide additional competition for City contracts.</p>
<p class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"">Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. on Monday, March 12, 2018.

Press Releases,668009,Smart Affordable Housing Investments by Portland Deliver More Bang for the Buck,1,,2018-01-04 21:09:10 UTC,2018-01-04 20:17:00 UTC,A,my administration has committed to dramatically increase the number of affordable housing units in Portland.,"<p><strong><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Framework Design "" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=668016"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""303.4"" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>January 3, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: Smart Affordable Housing Investments by Portland Deliver More Bang for the Buck</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our city is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis, brought on (in part) by decades of massive disinvestment in federal funding for affordable housing, an underinvestment in housing development during the Great Recession, and a rapidly increasing local population that has created a significant supply and demand issue.&nbsp; As a result, my administration has committed to dramatically increase the number of affordable housing units in Portland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, my first year in office, the City &ndash; through the Housing Investment Committee (HIC) &ndash; approved more than 1,100 units of affordable housing. In all, the Portland Housing Bureau currently has projects underway that will preserve or create 2,200 homes for low and moderate-income Portlanders. Add to this total, the 1,300 affordable units that will be preserved or created under the Housing Bond, approved by voters in November of 2016, and we have begun to make tangible progress toward our housing goals.</p>
<p>The City recently approved funding for a Pearl District development called Framework, which demonstrates how smart funding decisions can leverage federal and philanthropic resources to produce more affordable housing units. The project will cost nearly $29 million, but the city investment is modest, at $6 million. That&rsquo;s like paying for a Toyota and getting a Tesla in return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Framework was the only project in the River District that was submitted for funding. We approved this funding due to the project&rsquo;s ability to leverage a variety of funding and because the Pearl has been designated a &ldquo;Metropolitan Difficult to Develop Neighborhood&rdquo; by the federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some important things to know about the Framework project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every housing unit in the development will be affordable to households making up to 60% of the Area Median Income, or $35,880 a year for a family of two.</li>
<li>With a $6 million investment by the City, Portland gets 60 affordable housing units. That&rsquo;s $100,000 per unit, which is on par with other City investments in affordable housing.</li>
<li>The City&rsquo;s funds will be leveraged to bring in more than three times our investment in additional outside dollars, including but not limited to tax credits and private funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to leverage our investment is essential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework will be the tallest high-rise structure in the U.S. made from wood, built with a new timber technology called Cross Laminated Timber (CLT). This new technology has the promise of allowing us to build taller and faster in way that is both seismically safe and cost effective. Further, CLT production can provide a much-needed boost to the rural Oregon economy without compromising our environmental values. The majority of the cost premium of using CLT will be funded by philanthropic sources.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The housing units are intended to be affordable for 99 years, made possible in part by an up-front investment in quality materials and sustainable technology. Less maintenance and repair over time translates into lower rents throughout the life of the building.</li>
<li>The Framework project will be developed in one of the Central City&rsquo;s most vibrant neighborhoods, close to a wealth of transit options and good employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obama administration Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said about Framework, &ldquo;By embracing the benefits of wood as a sustainable building material, these demonstration projects [Framework and 475 West 18th in NY] have the ability to help change the face of our communities, mitigate climate change and support jobs in rural America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innovations made possible by this development are why Framework has been recognized with the Portland Design Commission Excellence Award, the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize, an Honorable Mention at the Architects Newspaper Best of Design Awards (Research Category), and has attracted funding from organizations like Home Forward, Meyer Memorial Trust, and the Oregon Community Foundation.</p>
<p>As we work to solve our housing emergency, we must continue to be vigilant about the effective use of public dollars dedicated to this effort. Smart investments, made transparently, toward projects that meet their budgets and timelines, will help us deliver more affordable housing while maintaining the trust of the public.</p>

Press Releases,666845,Letter to Portlanders on the end of 2017,1,,2017-12-20 18:28:05 UTC,2017-12-20 18:24:00 UTC,A,"The end of the year is a time to reflect upon where we’ve been, the challenges we’ve faced, what we’ve accomplished, and where we resolve to go in the year ahead.","<p>Dear Fellow Portlanders,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of the year is a time to reflect upon where we&rsquo;ve been, the challenges we&rsquo;ve faced, what we&rsquo;ve accomplished, and where we resolve to go in the year ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Portland City Council took real action to improve our city and the lives of our people. You can read more about what we&rsquo;ve accomplished together here:&nbsp;<a href=""/wheeler/article/666844"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/666844</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of my first year in office, I have sought to establish a collaborative approach to governing, one that takes advantage of the experience, expertise, and resources of my fellow commissioners and the city bureaus. For the first time in years, City Council is defined by consensus rather than conflict, with 5-0 votes becoming the rule rather than the exception. We passed a budget that focuses on investments in key areas, including homeless services, housing, infrastructure, public safety, and disaster resilience. We&rsquo;ve asked our bureaus to focus on mission-critical programs and to break down the silos that have traditionally held back progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strong partnerships we&rsquo;ve established among the Council and between bureaus, combined with our sustained focus on the core functions of our city government, have led to progress in 2017 and laid the groundwork for a successful 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progress has not come easy. In January, I took office with a storm at my back, quite literally, and during the early months of my term, my administration confronted a series of events &ndash; acts of nature and acts of man &ndash; that couldn&rsquo;t have been predicted. We experienced an unprecedented series of winter weather events that stressed our transportation system and cost lives. The inauguration of President Trump was followed closely by attempts to institute a travel ban and crack down on sanctuary cities, leading to unrest on the streets of Portland. Protests continued as the national debate about policing in America took on added local significance. Tragedy visited Portland on Memorial Day Weekend, when two men lost their lives and another was injured for doing the right thing, standing up for people they didn't know against hatred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My administration did not plan to spend our first months governing from one crisis to the next, but we took on each crisis as it came, all the while making progress on the issues Portlanders care about most: housing, homelessness, public safety, economic growth, environmental protection, equity, and government transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find more information on the concrete steps we took in 2017 here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""/wheeler/article/666844"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/666844</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland has established a reputation as a growing, vibrant city, recognized nationally and internationally for our innovative approach to transit, planning, and sustainability. Our economy is thriving, with near-record low unemployment and record high revenues from business licenses. People are moving here from around the world to participate in what our community has to offer, including diverse employment opportunities, thriving and unique neighborhoods, world-class restaurants and access to nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we look forward to 2018, we must acknowledge that tremendous challenges lie ahead. Solving them will not be easy. But we are a can-do city and mine is a can-do administration. Working together, we can continue the progress we began this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am honored to serve as your Mayor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<strong></strong></p>
<p>July 24, 2018</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>City Council To Vote On Portland&rsquo;s First Rental Registration System</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>The Rental Registration system data will help to provide essential support for existing and potential tenant protection policies of the City.</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash;City Council will vote this week to create a Rental Registration System, a real-time and reliable inventory of residential rental housing units within the city to help to provide essential support for existing and potential tenant protection policies of the City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rental Registration system will benefit current and potential tenants by giving the City access to real-time data, which will help direct policies to better address Portland&rsquo;s housing crisis,&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;Both tenants and landlords agree: We need quality data. Most jurisdictions, including Gresham, Eugene, Seattle, and San Francisco have data and registration collection systems. It&rsquo;s time for Portland to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rental Registration system is the first step in collecting data on available rental units to better inform how the City creates housing policy and is a partnership between the Housing Bureau, Revenue Division, and Bureau of Technology Services. The data collected includes how many landlords there are in Portland, how many units and where they are located. By accessing real-time data, the City will be able to have a better idea of where to focus their efforts, and how the rental market is changing in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policies that could be created using data found in the system include: mandatory rental unit health and safety inspections, mandatory or voluntary landlord/tenant education and training, low-income household legal representation outreach and education, landlord/tenant mediation services outreach and education, landlord standards/training/certification, renter opportunity to purchase programs, sales and use conversion regulations, mandatory relocation administration/exemptions and rent stabilization administration/exemptions. The Housing Bureau will also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of any regulatory approach and better inform policymakers on decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its first year, the program delivery and metrics of the Rental Registration System will continue to be calibrated in a phased rollout. Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 (due for most filers in April 2019), the Revenue Division will require all rental property owners or property managers to register their residential rental activity and provide rental location addresses on a schedule to the Business License Tax return. There will be no fee in the first year of the program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler and Chair Kafoury Announce Funding Availability for Innovative Supportive Housing Pilot</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>The pilot will be the first time state and local agencies pair funding for housing development with service dollars in a targeted effort to address chronic homelessness.</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash;The Portland Housing Bureau (PHB), together with the Joint Office of Homeless Services, Multnomah County Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services, and Oregon Housing and Community Services, have announced more than $12 million in joint funding for project proposals that combine housing and mental health services in targeted effort to combat chronic homelessness. <strong></strong></p>
<p>The funding opportunity marks the first time funding to build affordable housing has been bundled with funding for the services residents will need to thrive in that housing. It also marks a first-of-its-kind partnership with the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This innovative pilot is the first of its kind&mdash;leveraging state, county and city partnerships in a targeted effort to better use our dollars to address chronic homelessness, with an emphasis on providing crucial mental health services&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;Homelessness is a national humanitarian crisis. It will take more than cities&mdash;but regional, state-wide and federal partnerships to solve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people need more than an apartment key to rebuild their lives. They also need treatment and services,&rdquo; says Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury. &ldquo;For those neighbors, the only answer to homelessness is a home of their own with the right support. This is exactly what this project represents, because nobody should have to deal with their crisis in full view of strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People experiencing mental health disabilities are the fastest growing segment of the population experiencing homelessness in Multnomah County.</p>
<p>PHB&rsquo;s Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), released today, calls on the development community and service providers for proposals that find cost efficiencies, demonstrate innovative design, and integrate support services in projects focused on homeless individuals experiencing mental illness. <br /> <br />Expanding Permanent Supportive Housing over the coming decade<strong>&mdash;by roughly 200 units a year&mdash;</strong>is a critical element of the local strategy to address chronic homelessness. Permanent Supportive Housing combines accessible, affordable housing and the supportive services, including mental health and addiction services. By packaging construction capital and support services funding together for the first time, the City and its partners hope to achieve a minimum of 50 PSH units through this pilot.</p>
<p>More importantly, they hope to encourage creative proposals for a replicable, cost-effective model that can be used to continue expanding Supportive Housing options, with a focus on projects that update the single-room occupancy (SRO) concept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The need for more permanent supportive housing exists across the entire state. And we know that it works. With that in mind, Oregon Housing and Community Services is thrilled to contribute $2 million to the City of Portland&rsquo;s efforts to increase supportive housing and end homelessness and housing instability for Oregon&rsquo;s most vulnerable community members,&rdquo; said Margaret Salazar, Director of Oregon Housing and Community Services.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMER 2018 AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY (NOFA)</strong></p>
<p>- Portland Housing Bureau - $10 million capital funding</p>
<p>- Oregon Housing and Community Services - $2 million from Mental Health Housing Fund</p>
<p>- Joint Office of Homeless Services &amp; Multnomah County Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services - $350K per year for services funding</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Statement by Mayor Ted Wheeler on Saturday Demonstrations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement on demonstrations planned for Saturday in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many planning to attend demonstrations this weekend at Waterfront Park. I continue to strongly reject the idea that violence or hate speech are legitimate means to a political end. Chief Outlaw and I have serious concerns about the potential for violence at this weekend&rsquo;s demonstrations.&nbsp; It is particularly troubling to me that individuals are posting publicly their intent to act out violently. We don&rsquo;t want this here. The Police Bureau has put forth significant effort into preparing for tomorrow&rsquo;s demonstration and will do their best to provide a safe environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Outlaw will be in command of the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s response for Saturday&rsquo;s demonstrations. I have complete confidence in her leadership and the Police Bureau&rsquo;s ability to appropriately manage this challenging situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Background</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">The mission of law enforcement is to provide a safe environment for all participants, non-participants, and community members while ensuring the peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights. Federal law and First Amendment protections have consistently found that 1) a jurisdiction cannot deny permits based on free speech, and 2) a demonstration cannot be preemptively banned based on the occurrences at a prior demonstration. I have been an active participant in a national discussion about how to balance the right to free speech with the responsibilities that come with that right.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>City of Portland, PSU, PGE and MIT Partnering on First-Ever Emergency Preparedness Hub</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">PREPHub will provide crucial services to Portland residents during a disaster.</p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash;The City of Portland, Portland State University and Portland General Electric, with guidance from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are partnering to create a PREPHub (Emergency Preparedness Hubs) Pilot, a program to improve disaster resilience and emergency preparedness in Portland. Portland City Council voted to approve the agreement today.</p>
<p>PREPHubs are a new kind of infrastructure designed to operate entirely off-grid during a disaster, providing crucial services that include power, communication and emergency first aid supplies. The hubs will be able to recharge emergency communications, equipment and cell phones during and immediately after a natural disaster. They also provide secure, locked storage for Basic Earthquake Emergency Communication Node (BEECN) cache equipment. BEECNs are places for Portland residents to go after a major earthquake or other disaster to ask for emergency assistance and get information. PGE will provide power to the PREPHubs from the electric grid and from energy storage devices, supplemented by solar arrays and pedal-power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Portland is leading the nation in testing innovative solutions to emergency preparedness thanks to MIT,&rdquo; says Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;These hubs will serve as a place for the community to gather so that residents feel safe and prepared. I am proud that Portland can serve as a testing ground for innovation and can serve as a model for other cities in promoting community resilience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first PREPHub will be located on the Portland State University campus and is expected to be installed in 2019.</p>
<p>""Locating Portland&rsquo;s first PREPHub on the PSU campus is yet another demonstration of the way the university&rsquo;s research expertise serves the city,&rdquo; says Portland State University President Rahmat Shoureshi. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited that our faculty and students will get to test out the capabilities of this new technology, paving the way for more PREPHubs in the future.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PREPHub project will provide our communities with an important energy resource in the event of a natural disaster,&rdquo; says Maria Pope, president and CEO, Portland General Electric. &ldquo;Successful disaster response depends on partnerships. This project will also inform PGE&rsquo;s work to use technological advances to build a smarter, more resilient grid for customers.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>""PREPHubs are designed to increase disaster preparedness at the neighborhood level, while also providing critical power and communications needs in the event of a disaster. We have developed different manifestations of the PREPHub project since 2014, supported by research on disaster response and preparedness in cities around the world,&rdquo; says Miho Mazereeuw, Associate Professor of Architecture and Urbanism, Director of the MIT Urban Risk Lab. &ldquo;We are extremely excited to be able to work with the City of Portland, Portland State University, and Portland General Electric to turn that research into a new PREPHub prototype, designed especially for and with the people of Portland.""</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>August 8, 2018</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Reassigns Bureaus to Improve Collaboration and Get Results </strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Each commissioner receives new assignments effective September 4.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; Today, Mayor Ted Wheeler announced bureau assignments in a major reorganization meant to improve governance and city-wide collaboration, while generating results on key challenges facing the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s improving planning and permitting, enhancing public safety, or maintaining critical infrastructure, the idea is to group like bureaus together under a single commissioner to better align work in important subject areas,&rdquo; said Wheeler. &ldquo;While the sheer number of bureaus, combined with the unique skills and interests of each commissioner, means we can&rsquo;t do that across the board, the assignments I&rsquo;ve made will lead to improved partnerships among commissioners and better results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler announced he will assign to himself major planning bureaus, including the Portland Housing Bureau, Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Prosper Portland, and &ndash; in a new assignment &ndash; the Bureau of Development Services. Mayor Wheeler will convene a regular meeting of the directors of these bureaus to significantly reduce the time it takes to bring projects &ndash; particularly housing &ndash; to market, to reduce the time and bureaucracy around permitting projects within the city, and to jumpstart key economic development opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler announced he will assign the non-police public safety bureaus &ndash; Portland Fire and Rescue, Bureau of Emergency Communications, Portland Bureau of Emergency Management, and Fire and Police Disability and Retirement &ndash; to Dan Saltzman, with the expectation that the incoming commissioner will take on the assignments in January. The commissioner will include the Portland Police Bureau in efforts to improve the city&rsquo;s preparedness, emergency response and post-disaster resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responsibility for ensuring the city&rsquo;s infrastructure meets the needs and expectations of residents and businesses is spread across many bureaus. Collaboration among commissioners will be essential to achieve the council&rsquo;s goals to provide equitable access to transportation options, especially in East Portland; protect our natural areas, maintain stewardship over the environment, and increase public access to the Willamette River; transform the cityscape to reflect our status as a global destination; and implement programs like Build Portland to maintain our commitment to preserving our roads, parks, and other civic infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is transitioning from a big city with a small city feel to a truly global city, and we&rsquo;re confronted with all the opportunities and difficulties that come with it,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;These bureau assignments link the daily management of the city with a vision for the future of Portland as an equitable, sustainable, and economically vibrant city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New assignments will take effect on Tuesday, September 4. You can find a complete list of the assignments linked here:&nbsp;<a href=""/wheeler/article/693740"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/693740</a></p>

<p class=""s10""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""s5"">Portland, OR<strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The City of Portland, along with the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://www.cfefund.org/"">Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund</a>&nbsp;(CFE Fund) announced their selection as one of ten cities to receive a planning grant and technical assistance to identify and plan for local municipal financial empowerment strategic priorities. The CFE Fund&rsquo;s CityStart initiative, with support from JPMorgan Chase and others, offers mayors and their administrations a structured approach to identify financial empowerment goals, convene stakeholders for sustainable success, develop concrete strategies, and ultimately craft an actionable blueprint rooted in local priorities and opportunities. Portland will receive an intensive 6-9 month technical assistance engagement partnership, along with a $20,000 planning grant. In addition to Portland, other selected cities chosen through a competitive process include: Albuquerque, NM; Anchorage, AK: Dallas, TX; Durham, NC; El Paso, TX; Fort Worth, TX; Portland, OR; Rochester, NY; Saint Paul, MN; and Tulsa, OK.</p>
<p class=""s5"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A key goal of my administration to is create opportunities for individual community members to share in Portland's economic development success and gain access to financial empowerment opportunities,&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler.&nbsp;&ldquo;As our local economy continues to grow, it&rsquo;s important to me that everyone in our community has the opportunity to achieve financial empowerment.&nbsp;From the small business owner to the working family, I believe we can all share in Portland's economic growth and fiscal security, with the right framework and resources. This assistance and grant from the CFE Fund will help us empower even more hardworking people in our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cities control a host of policies, programs, and funding streams that can transform the lives of residents with low incomes on a large scale. Across the nation, more and more city leaders are embracing high-quality financial empowerment programs to improve the financial stability of their city residents and communities,&rdquo; said Jonathan Mintz, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund. &ldquo;We congratulate Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and look forward to working with him to empower Portland residents, and we thank JPMorgan Chase for their longstanding commitment to and investment in municipal financial empowerment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CityStart initiative draws on the CFE Fund&rsquo;s extensive programmatic work with local government leaders in over 60 cities, connecting critical on-the-ground insights about the impact of financial instability on families, communities, and municipal budgets with tangible, measurable, and sustainable municipal strategies to improve families' financial lives. Under Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s CityStart initiative, the Mayor, working with the CFE Fund, will construct and then host a day-long municipal financial empowerment ""boot camp"" event that brings together key local constituencies. Based on issues identified in the boot camp, the City of Portland will craft its municipal financial empowerment blueprint identifying actionable implementation steps. CityStart cities have historically leveraged their engagement with the CFE Fund to further their commitment to this work.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The purpose of the Expanding Opportunities for Affordable Housing in Faith Communities Project is for the City to partner with the faith community to develop a system to connect faith communities with developers that need access to affordable land.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The director of BPS will be authorized to work with nonprofits with missions that include serving low-income households, communities of color or immigrants and refugees, as they are uniquely positioned to partner with the City to ensure this Project is informed by input from these communities.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>This action removes properties which do not meet the owner occupancy requirements or are selling to over-income homebuyers. This is the result of ongoing reviews to ensure program compliance to effectively promote&nbsp;first-time home ownership opportunities for low and moderate-income homebuyers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Over the last two years, the City and Oregon Solutions have engaged multiple state and federal agencies, researchers, community stakeholders, and hundreds of business owners and residents in a process to identify solutions to advance the community&rsquo;s goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The result of this process is a Declaration of Cooperation outlining the priorities for action and specific commitments each of the project partners has made. Commitments include measures to help create jobs, preserve affordable housing options for residents, and enhance and improve community access to natural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""/auditor/article/696582""><strong>Item 952</strong></a><strong> -- Item Formalization of the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP) Plan</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>This resolution will approve changes to the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing Plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Portland Committee for Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP) Appointees Selected</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>The decision comes after receiving more than 100 applications from qualified candidates.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash;The Office of the Mayor is formally announcing the appointees of the 13-member PCCEP today. The decision comes after receiving more than 100 applications from qualified candidates and conducting interviews with 17 adult candidates and 6 high school-aged youth, based on recommendations from the Selection Advisory Committee (SAC). Following an extensive outreach effort with a focus on removing barriers to participation for historically marginalized communities, the Mayor has appointed 13 Portlanders to serve on the PCCEP, and six Portlanders to serve as alternates.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>The Mayor&rsquo;s Office is proud to spearhead the PCCEP to develop recommendations for how the Portland Police Bureau can better engage the community in its development of policies that directly affect Portlanders, with a specific focus on racial justice, constitutional policing and mental health issues. The PCCEP selection process was facilitated by Brandon Lee and Hun Taing of Training for Transformation and Brad Taylor of The Brad Taylor Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am completely confident in the abilities, perspectives and experiences of every single PCCEP appointee to take on this challenging and meaningful work,&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;This is about more than the Settlement Agreement: The PCCEP represents a unique and important opportunity to improve the community&rsquo;s relationship with the Portland Police Bureau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After working together to draft interview questions, the Selection Advisory Committee (SAC), whose five-person membership was developed through direct appointments made by the City Commissioners and the Mayor. The SAC assessed the applications of over 100 candidates in an effort to determine who would be interviewed as the committee worked towards recommending members for appointment to the Portland Committee on Community Engaged Policing (PCCEP). Discussions around who to interview and initial recommendations to the Mayor were the sole responsibility of the SAC. The Mayor&rsquo;s Office was not involved in any part of the SAC&rsquo;s selection process. After consulting with Commissioner offices, Mayor Wheeler then interviewed the candidates before making the final selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, the community will have continued engagement with the PCCEP, whose members will gather input from the community through culturally responsive and relevant strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of the monthly meetings, PCCEP members, with the support of PCCEP Facilitators, will engage community members in the places where community members already are active and in ways that accommodate various communication styles and comfort levels. PCCEP members will also be available for impacted/concerned community members by establishing times where they will be out in the community and available to engage, hear and document the stories, concerns, questions, fears, experiences, ideas and wisdoms of the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be quarterly gatherings where the PCCEP will let the public know they have heard and how the public&rsquo;s words are impacting the work of the PCCEP, including recommendations to PPB and the City.</p>

<p><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>September 11, 2018</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Westwind Apartments Announced as Next Housing Bond Project <br /> </strong><em>The project will be dedicated to providing Supportive Housing for homeless individuals in downtown.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; The Portland Housing Bureau (PHB) has announced it is in the process of purchasing the Westwind Apartments for reconstruction with Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building at NW 6th Avenue and Flanders Street in Old Town currently provides 70 units of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing to extremely-low income and vulnerable tenants. PHB plans to replace the existing 70 units and pair the new housing with supportive services for individuals exiting homelessness. Multnomah County has committed $4 million toward the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Westwind provides an increasingly scarce type of housing that is vital to our efforts to tackling homelessness in the central city. Funding these kinds of housing solutions for our most vulnerable neighbors is extremely important to me,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thankful to Multnomah County for their generous partnership. Collaboration between the City of Portland and Multnomah County is essential to create supportive housing. I am confident we have the right infrastructure to address a fast-growing population with extreme needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For decades, the Westwind&rsquo;s low-cost, low-barrier housing has been a vital asset for many social service agencies operating in the central city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled about the purchase of the Westwind. It has provided housing for some of our most vulnerable residents,&rdquo; said Bond Oversight Committee member Susan Emmons, who previously served as the Executive Director at Northwest Pilot Project. &ldquo;Because of its low-barrier housing, it became one of the only options for people that we served.&nbsp; The location is important because it is so close to service providers who refer people to the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Housing Bond, passed in 2016, promised 1,300 units of affordable housing by 2023. The Westwind will mark the fifth Bond project to move forward to date, totaling more than 630 units of permanently affordable housing planned or purchased under the Bond so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Westwind is one of the last remaining Single Room Occupancy buildings providing low-barrier unregulated affordable housing in the central city. We&rsquo;re grateful to have this opportunity to buy it and replace the housing with safe, high-quality, long-lasting homes with support services,&rdquo; said Portland Housing Bureau director Shannon Callahan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project helps further the commitment by Portland and Multnomah County to create 2,000 units of Supportive Housing by 2028. Supportive Housing &mdash; which combines deep affordability with intensive care, including mental health and addiction services &mdash; is part of the local strategy for ensuring chronically homeless neighbors can leave our streets and remain stably housed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Westwind acquisition marks the second supportive housing project in recent weeks that joins City and County funding. That speaks to the cooperation and coordination that meeting the 2,000-unit goal will require.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The solution to chronic homelessness is supportive housing, and in places where people can reconnect with their community,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Commissioner Lori Stegmann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled the County&rsquo;s contribution is making that possible for some of our most vulnerable neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHB expects to bring the acquisition to Portland City Council for approval later this fall. For more information, visit <a href=""http://www.portlandhousingbond.com"">www.portlandhousingbond.com</a>.</p>

<p>Portland, OR&ndash;Mayor Wheeler is introducing seven notable items in City Council this week. A brief description of each is below. The entire Council Agenda is <a href=""/auditor/26997"">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697808""><strong>Item 986</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Legal Fund for Immigration Services </strong><em>(Introduced by Mayor Wheeler and Commissioner Eudaly)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This ordinance authorizes a $500,000 grant with Catholic Charities to support the Universal Representation Project through the Equity Corps of Oregon. The Universal Representation Project is a grant to the Legal Service Providers (LSP) Members to fund the equivalent of one full-time attorney at each LSP for one year to provide high-quality immigration legal service, giving immigrants a safe place to seek assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697809""><strong>Item 987</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Increasing Supportive Housing </strong><em>(Introduced by Mayor Wheeler, Commissioners Eudaly and Fish)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This item is a formal acceptance of the report <a href=""/auditor/article/697809""><em>Scaling Smart Resources, Doing What Works: A System-Level Path to Producing 2,000 Units of Supportive Housing in Portland and Multnomah County</em></a>, which responds to City Council&rsquo;s request for the Portland Housing Bureau to bring back a plan for producing 2,000 new supportive housing units by 2028. Supportive housing is deeply affordable housing with ongoing wrap around support services attached.</p>
<p>The report was presented in a joint session to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners and Portland City Council last week. You can find out more about that session <a href=""https://multco.us/multnomah-county/news/amid-record-setting-homelessness-response-multnomah-county-portland-deliver"">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697811""><strong>Item 989</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Homeownership Financial Assistance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The resolution will revise the Homeownership Assistance Program Guidelines to align homeownership assistance with the current policy goals for minority homeownership and home retention. The Portland Housing Bureau will provide Homeownership Assistance that creates affordable homeownership opportunities for low-income homebuyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revisions will support low income and minority homeowners, using City resources to help purchase their home, by allowing them to access more of the equity gained in their homes, providing greater opportunity for homeownership retention and wealth creation. The revisions eliminate the concerns of significant financial burdens on older or fixed income homeowners who would be responsible for paying back a large debt after 30 years. PHB will reduce the amount owed on the loan in year 15 incrementally per year the property is owned, until the loan balance is reduced in whole by year 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697812""><strong>Item 990</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Affordable Housing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This ordinance will approve the Multiple-Unit Limited Tax Exemption Program (MULTE) application under the Inclusionary Housing Program for Division Two, located at 3249 SE Division St.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MULTE program provides a 10-year property tax exemption to developments complying with the City&rsquo;s Inclusionary Housing Program, which requires 99 years of affordability. The project will restrict 8%, or 2 units, of the Project&rsquo;s 54 units to households earning no more than 60% of the <a href=""/phb/article/684577"">Median Family Income</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697813""><strong>Item 991</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Affordable Housing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ordinance will approve the MULTE application under the Inclusionary Housing Program for the Ellis Apartments, located at 5603 SE Milwaukie Ave. This project will restrict 100%, or 30 units, to households earning no more than 60% of the Median Family Income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697814""><strong>Item 992</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Affordable Housing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This ordinance will approve the Multiple-Unit Limited Tax Exemption Program (MULTE) application under the Inclusionary Housing Program for Multnomah Station Apartments, located at 7654 SW 32<sup>nd</sup> Ave. This project will restrict 8%, or 1 unit, of the project&rsquo;s 39 units to households earning no more than 60% of the Median Family Income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><a href=""/auditor/article/697819""><strong>Item 997</strong></a><strong> &ndash; Clean Diesel</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This resolution directs Procurement Services and the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability to develop contracting standards for City construction projects that will control diesel exhaust from construction equipment to protect public health.</p>
<p>Portland faces the highest risks from air toxics in the State of Oregon, and in particular has the highest levels of diesel particulate pollution. Furthermore, communities of color and low-income populations experience a disproportionate burden of exposure to diesel pollution because they often live and work in areas with higher pollution levels. It is essential the City work with regional partners to ensure a consistent clean air construction strategy, including options for contractor technical assistance and compliance enforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>City of Portland and Multnomah County staff have been working together for over two years to develop a regional strategy to reducing diesel pollution from public construction projects, collaborating with regional partners including Clackamas County, Washington County, Port of Portland, Metro, and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Multnomah County will also be introducing a resolution at this week&rsquo;s Board of Commissioners Meeting affirming the County&rsquo;s intent to establish a clean air construction procurement policy that aligns with this regional approach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the early hours of Sunday morning an officer-involved shooting led to the death of a man named Patrick Kimmons. My thoughts are with his family and those affected by Sunday&rsquo;s events, including the officers involved, witnesses, and our community partners who work every day to reduce conflict and violence in Portland. In the coming days and weeks, many will rightly have questions about what happened. These questions are important; the answers are important.

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Statement on FCC Limiting Local Authority in 5G Rollout</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Portland strongly opposes the FCC&rsquo;s recent two items that effectively give away public property for free to cable and wireless companies. Rather than speed the deployment of high speed internet, the FCC&rsquo;s actions trample local authority without asking the cable and wireless industries for anything in return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Portland wants to advance 5G deployment in its public right of way, but not by asking Portland residents to subsidize the wireless industry&rsquo;s business costs and neglecting the thousands of residents who cannot afford high speed internet. Requiring cities to subsidize the wireless industry&rsquo;s deployment of 5G without requiring the wireless industry to serve low-income communities will not close the current digital divide. The City looks forward to negotiating in good faith with companies that are committed to bringing the essential service of high speed internet to our entire community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>City officials began talks&nbsp;this week with several national&nbsp;telecommunications companies that want to offer 5G Internet service in Portland. Mayor Wheeler and Commissioner Eudaly provided guidance to direct the city's negotiations (memo attached).</p>

<p><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>October 2, 2018</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Statement on Special Council Meeting Resolution</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Portland, OR&mdash;In the last three months, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a series of reports, orders and declaratory rulings that seek to significantly limit the City of Portland&rsquo;s ability to manage its rights of way. Approximately 20 percent of land in the City is dedicated public rights of way (streets, sidewalks and everything underneath) and Portland&rsquo;s residents have invested billions of dollars to build and maintain this public asset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City Council&rsquo;s resolution authorizes the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office to file a complaint, or join as a co-plaintiff in a complaint, against the federal government and its officials to maintain local control of, and reasonable compensation for access to, the City of Portland&rsquo;s public rights of way.</p>
<p>Statement from Mayor Wheeler:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today the City of Portland held a Special Meeting to meet a deadline authorizing the City Attorney to challenge recent FCC orders that exceed the FCC&rsquo;s statutory authority. Portland is ready and willing to lead the fight to protect local control of local assets. As FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel acknowledged in voicing her dissent in part on one of the FCC&rsquo;s orders: &lsquo;This is extraordinary federal overreach...Washington is seeking to assert national control over local infrastructure choices and stripping local elected officials and the citizens they represent of a voice in the process.&rsquo; Portland agrees with Commissioner Rosenworcel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only is the FCC invading local authority, but its overreach in favor of billion-dollar wireless corporations will not close the digital divide and could negatively affect the city&rsquo;s ability to fund programs that seek to bring affordable internet access to the estimated 15% of Portland households without it. The City of Portland is dedicated to bridging the digital divide. The city is also dedicated to receiving fair value when corporations generate profit from placing infrastructure in our community&rsquo;s public assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the last three months, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a series of reports, orders and declaratory rulings that seek to significantly limit the City of Portland&rsquo;s ability to manage its rights of way. The City Council&rsquo;s resolution authorizes the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office to file a complaint, or join as a co-plaintiff in a complaint, against the federal government and its officials to maintain local control of, and reasonable compensation for access to, the City of Portland&rsquo;s public rights of way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699050"">Item 1024</a>: Indigenous People&rsquo;s Day Proclamation</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This proclamation will proclaim October 8 to be Indigenous People&rsquo;s Day in Portland, and encourages all residents, business, organizations and public institutions to observe this day by reflecting upon the ongoing struggles of Indigenous Peoples on this land, and to celebrate the thriving culture and value that Indigenous Peoples add to our city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699051"">Item 1025</a>: Elders In Action Grant</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance authorizes a $165,667 grant for Elders In Action to provide services and advocacy for older adults in the City of Portland. The grant is part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s commitment to provide the older adult community with an opportunity to engage civically, though volunteerism and leadership building of elders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699052"">Item 1026</a>: Latino Network Grant</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance authorizes a $44,737 grant for Latino Network for its making open and accountable elections work for all Portlanders program. Open and accountable elections is an important program offering an alternative path to run for elected office in Portland, offering the opportunity to expand the pool of those who run and those who support candidates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699053"">Item 1027</a>: Metropolitan Family Services Grant</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance authorizes a $200,000 grant for Metropolitan Family Services for its Experience PDX program to continue critical academic support to children at academic risk and to enhance outcomes at four low-resourced Portland schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699076"">Item 1033</a>: Establishes the Office of Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy (Introduced by Mayor Wheeler and Commissioner Saltzman)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance will establish the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy as its own office in the City of Portland. In May 2018, Portland voted for the Children&rsquo;s Levy to be renewed for a third time. Establishing the Office of the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy creates a bureau structured constituently with other city bureaus rather than maintaining the Children&rsquo;s Levy as a specific project embedded in a commissioner&rsquo;s office, as it has been for previous years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699062"">Item 1039</a>: Placards and Tenant Notification for Unreinforced Masonry</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance will amend the Seismic Design Requirements for Existing Buildings to require owners to provide placards for unreinforced masonry buildings and notify tenants living in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/auditor/article/699063"">Item 1040</a>: Adopt the Southwest Corridor Equitable Housing Strategy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resolution will adopt the Southwest Corridor Equitable Housing Strategy and direct early implementation actions. The strategy was designed to respond the impacts a major transit investment can have on low-income households and communities of color.</p>
<p>Background: In 2016, City Council directed the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability to develop a Southwest Corridor Equitable Housing Strategy in anticipation of a regional investment in light rail transit improvements, with the goal of ensuring a new Southwest Corridor light rail line benefits rather than displaces the most vulnerable households. The City recognizes that past housing strategies related to new light rail did not successfully prevent the displacement of communities of color and low-income households. In forming this strategy, the City of Portland and the City of Tigard worked with community-based organizations working directly with low-income households and communities of color in the corridor to engage those populations and ensure the Southwest Corridor Equitable Housing Strategy reflects the priorities of those households most impacted by institutional and structural racism and the increasing cost of living in our region.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Introduces Three Notable Items in City Council This Week</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>This week&rsquo;s agenda includes reports on digital equity and historic landmarks.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash; Three notable items are coming to City Council this week, as introduced by Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s Office. A description of each is below. You can view the entire agenda here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Item 1046 &ndash; <a href=""/auditor/article/699619"">Digital Equity Action Plan</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This item will approve the two-year Digital Equity Action Plan (DEAP) two-year progress report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, Digital Equity Action Plan activities have been purposeful and far reaching across the County. Digital Equity means having access to affordable high-speed internet, a device to connect and the know-how to navigate in the digital world. Digital inclusion is a moral and economic imperative for the City of Portland. There are still many of our neighbors who do not have the means to access technology. And for these individuals, who often represent some of our most vulnerable populations, it&rsquo;s important to identify how to reach and best serve them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Item 1049 &ndash; <a href=""/auditor/article/699621"">Bloomberg Philanthropies application for funding for the city&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ordinance will authorize a grant application for Bloomberg&rsquo;s American Cities Climate Challenge for technical assistance and a support package valued at approximately $2 million to support the City of Portland&rsquo;s progress towards achieving the goals of the Climate Action Plan, which focuses on reducing carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and 40 percent by 2030. Reaching these emission reduction goals requires bold vision and aggressive action. The American Cities Climate Challenge provides an opportunity access resources, support and technical assistance to advance key actions in the buildings and transportation sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Item 1063 &ndash; <a href=""/auditor/article/699632"">2018 Portland Historic Landmarks Commission State of the City Preservation Report</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This item formally accepts a report by the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission, which provides leadership and expertise on maintaining and enhancing Portland&rsquo;s architectural and cultural heritage. The Commission reviews development proposals for alterations to historic buildings and new construction in historic districts. The Commission also provides advice on historic preservation matters and coordinates historic preservation programs in the City.</p>

<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing content-center""><em>Mayor will introduce ordinance to establish reasonable content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations for demonstrations held in the City.</em><strong></strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">Portland, OR &ndash; Mayor Ted Wheeler released the following statement, vowing action to crack down on recurring street brawls in Portland.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;There are some basic ideals we should be able to agree on as Americans: We don&rsquo;t tolerate violence in our streets. Violence is not&mdash;and has never been&mdash;a legitimate means to a political end.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I will not allow continued, planned street violence between rival factions to take place in Portland, Oregon. And I will ask those in positions of influence &ndash; elected officials, lawyers and law enforcement, community organizations, and people of conscience &ndash; to join with me.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Portland will do our part.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I will introduce, as soon as possible, an ordinance to enact reasonable content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations for demonstrations held in the City, with the goal of protecting both the freedom of expression for demonstrators and the safety of the entire community.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;I have also asked my staff to evaluate options to hold accountable those who recklessly drain our public safety resources by using our city as a venue for planned street violence.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;As Portland does our part, I will call on other jurisdictions to do theirs.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;We have agreements with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, and we will ask them to help us prevent violence. We will ask prosecutors, and jails to enforce laws against those planning or engaging in violence. And we will ask those with investigatory authority to bring forward a full suite of options for changing the dynamic on our streets.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;This is not a partisan issue. This is not about ideology. This goes beyond Democrat and Republican. This is about delivering a strong and principled message that we will not tolerate violence in our community.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>October 17, 2018</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mike Bloomberg Names Portland Winner in Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Portland is one of 20 cities to be awarded with resources and technical support to help achieve its ambitious climate goals under Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge.</em><strong></strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Portland, OR&ndash; Bloomberg Philanthropies today announced Portland as a winning city in the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge. The Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge is a $70 million program that will accelerate 20 ambitious cities&rsquo; efforts to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future for residents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Climate Challenge &ndash; which is part of Bloomberg&rsquo;s American Cities Initiative, a suite of more than $200 million in investments to strengthen city halls and advance critical policies &ndash; the City of Portland is accepted into a two-year acceleration program, will be provided powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support to help meet or beat the City&rsquo;s near-term carbon reduction goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomberg Philanthropies selected Portland as a winning city because of its innovative and ambitious climate action plans to reduce air pollution and city-wide emissions with specific projects aimed at reforming their respective transportation and buildings sectors, areas which are typically responsible for 90 percent of all citywide emissions and are areas over which mayors have significant authority. Bloomberg Philanthropies also recognizes Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly for their commitment to ambitious climate action and securing a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment and economy for their citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Cities are helping to keep America moving forward on climate change despite the lack of leadership from Washington, and this challenge was designed to help innovative cities reach their goals,&rdquo; said Mike Bloomberg. &ldquo;We were looking for cities with ambitious and realistic plans to cut emissions in ways that improve people&rsquo;s lives, and mayors committed to getting the job done. Each of these winning cities brings those ingredients to the table - and we&rsquo;re looking forward to working with them and seeing what they can accomplish.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland has a long and proud history of leading on environmental initiatives,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited and honored to be a recipient of the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge grant. With these resources, we&rsquo;ll be able to develop and implement policies and programs that will keep Portland at the forefront of city leadership on climate issues. Now more than ever, this type of action at the city level is necessary if we are to seriously address the important and pressing issue of climate change.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland Bureau of Transportation and the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability deserve credit for winning a highly competitive application process to become a Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge Leadership City,"" Eudaly said. ""I am looking forward to working with the Bloomberg team to reduce carbon pollution in our transportation system by managing congestion and making walking, biking, and using public transportation more attractive, safe options. Bloomberg&rsquo;s support, combined with the City of Portland&rsquo;s ongoing work and community-based initiatives like the Portland Clean Energy Fund, will enable us invest in innovative strategies that will improve our economy and our health as well as demonstrate how cities can lead the fight against climate change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation and the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability are the two agencies that will receive the grant and technical assistance from Bloomberg Philanthropies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winners of the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge will be provided robust technical assistance and a support package valued at up to $2.5 million per city. Portland plans to use this support to reduce climate pollution in transportation and promote renewable energy use throughout the city.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Philanthropies will work the City to achieve the following actions by 2020:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Manage congestion in the Central City with zero growth in single-occupant vehicle trips, expanding incentives such as the Transportation Wallet, that make it easier for all Portlanders to walk, bike or take public transport instead of drive;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Use apps and other new data sources to provide analysis and evaluation of the City's upcoming public transit and bicycle infrastructure investments;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Implement performance-based parking pricing and prioritize curb parking spaces to reduce congestion by encouraging higher-occupancy trips, such as public transit and carpools that use ride-sharing services;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Ensure City buildings are highly efficient and powered by clean, renewable energy, in order to reach our goal of all facilities being carbon-free by 2030;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Support the development of community-owned renewable energy projects like large solar arrays, especially within Portland&rsquo;s low-income communities and communities of color.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Climate Challenge winners, the 20 cities will be accepted into a two-year acceleration program with powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support to help them meet &ndash; or beat &ndash; their near-term carbon reduction goals. These resources include a philanthropy-funded team member to facilitate the development and passage of high impact policies, training for senior leadership to assist with implementation of their proposed climate plans, and citizen engagement support to maximize community buy-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.americaspledgeonclimate.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">America&rsquo;s Pledge</a>&nbsp;initiative, which aims to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement, the Climate Challenge underscores Bloomberg&rsquo;s dedication to action as this investment will translate city commitments into tangible climate achievements. Bloomberg will announce the remaining winners of the Climate Challenge on a rolling basis throughout the fall, highlighting the ongoing, ambitious, and impactful actions cities are taking every day to address the growing threat of climate change.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Portland &amp; Seattle win Legal Fight with Trump/Sessions Order</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Federal Judge rules Trump&rsquo;s executive order against Sanctuary Cities is Unconstitutional</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington has ruled the Trump&rsquo;s Administration&rsquo;s Executive Order attempting to withhold federal funding from the sanctuary jurisdictions of Seattle and Portland, is unconstitutional. The court&rsquo;s ruling was based on the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision a few weeks ago, holding in another case that the Executive Order violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers because &ldquo;there is no reasonable argument that the President has not exceeded his authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Executive Order violates the constitutional principle of the Separation of Powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a clear victory for the City of Portland and the rule of law,&rdquo; said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, &ldquo;Judge Jones&rsquo; ruling only provides further evidence that President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions lack a basic understanding of the roles, responsibilities, and constitutional boundaries of their offices. As Mayor of the City of Portland, we will continue to work with our partner cities to protect our residents and build stronger relationships with the immigrant community.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Will Introduce a Protest Safety Ordinance in City Council</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; Over the last two years, the City of Portland has seen its fair share of violent protests. This repeated occurrence continues to impact our businesses, residents, and the safety of our community. That is why Mayor Ted Wheeler will introduce a Protest Safety Ordinance to City Council for 2:15 pm on Thursday, November 8 where there will be opportunity for public testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If passed, the ordinance will continue to uphold 1<sup>st</sup> amendment rights, while establishing specific guidelines -- for demonstrations held in the city. The goal of this ordinance is to protect both the freedom of expression for demonstrators and the safety of the entire community. You can read the ordinance that was filed to the clerk in the document attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland would join cities like Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Long Beach, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Raleigh &ndash; in offering time, place, and manner regulations for demonstrations. Other cities who have imposed restrictions for specific demonstrations have been challenged on their decisions, but successfully had their regulations upheld in court. Cities like: New York, Seattle, Denver, Colorado Spring, Tacoma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is one of the most vibrant, livable and economically prosperous cities in the U.S, and we have a robust history of peaceful demonstrations &mdash; but in recent years we&rsquo;ve become a magnet for agitators either with a history of -- or an expressed intent to be violent,&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;We created common-sense, content-neutral legislation to protect the safety and property of the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Attorney General and Governor Kate Brown Sue U.S. Government After Feds Refuse Grant Money to Oregon</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>The U.S. government is citing Oregon sanctuary laws that limit state&rsquo;s participation in federal immigration enforcement.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Governor Kate Brown filed a lawsuit today against the U.S. government, saying that the federal government should not be allowed to force the state of Oregon to cooperate with federal immigration priorities. City of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has announced his intent to ask the City Council to authorize the City to join that lawsuit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case focuses on the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s attempt to force Oregon to cooperate with federal immigration policies, using the threat of withholding&nbsp;federal law enforcement grants, called Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants. Congress sets the grants aside for community law enforcement programs around the country and did not tie the grants to immigration enforcement. However, DOJ refused to allocate the grants, citing Oregon sanctuary laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that two federal statutes that prevent the state from imposing some limits on employee communications with federal immigration authorities usurp state power and violate the U.S. Constitution. It also alleges that US DOJ&rsquo;s decision to impose conditions that Congress did not approve intrudes on congressional power.&nbsp;<strong>The goal of the lawsuit filed today is to ensure that the federal government cannot use Oregon resources to advance its poorly-considered immigration policies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler: </strong>&ldquo;The City of Portland&rsquo;s commitment to public safety is demonstrated by the resources we put behind those&nbsp;needs. The Byrne JAG grant has been a critical source of funding for programs that benefit the most marginalized members of our community. The City of Portland maintains that it is and has been in compliance with federal law, making the denial of federal funds to support our community unjust and unwarranted. We look forward to obtaining appropriate relief from the judicial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attorney General Rosenblum:</strong> &ldquo;For years, these grants have provided millions of dollars to law enforcement in Oregon. But, suddenly these public safety funds have been withdrawn because Oregon will not submit to US DOJ&rsquo;s demand that Oregon participate in its immigration enforcement efforts. As we have seen, these efforts have frequently been both inhumane and dangerous. Our police and other local law enforcement need to be able to protect all residents of our state&mdash;regardless of where they were born or their immigration status. We are all safer when all of our residents are not afraid to report crime to the to the police.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oregon Governor Kate Brown:</strong> &ldquo;Oregon voters sent a clear message to the Trump administration this week: Oregonians support our sanctuary laws. The Trump administration&rsquo;s attempts to withhold public safety dollars from our state is unjust, dangerous, and unconstitutional. All Oregonians, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to have the full protection of our law enforcement. We will not stand for this administration&rsquo;s attempts to strong-arm our state by withholding critical public safety dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>ENDORSEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PROTEST SAFETY ORDINANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: <em>Professor at Georgetown Law and successful litigator for Charlottesville during 2017 Unite the Right rally, endorses Portland&rsquo;s Protest Safety Ordinance.</em></p>
<p>Mary McCord is a senior litigator at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP) and a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.&nbsp; She previously was the Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the U.S. Department of Justice from 2016&ndash;2017, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security from 2014&ndash;2017, and an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Columbia for nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCord recently led successful litigation on behalf of the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, and local small businesses and neighborhood associations against alt-right, white nationalist, and militia organizations and individuals who engaged in paramilitary activity after the August 2017 Unite the Right rally, during which one person was killed and dozens injured.&nbsp; The lawsuit resulted in court orders permanently prohibiting the defendant individuals and organizations from returning to Charlottesville as part of a unit of two or more persons, acting in concert, while armed with any type of weapon during any protest, rally, demonstration, or march.</p>
<p>McCord submitted a statement to the Portland City Council today, on behalf of ICAP, opining that the proposed ordinance to <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">&ldquo;Authorize the Commissioner in Charge of the Police Bureau to Order Content-Neutral Time, Place, and Manner Regulations for Demonstrations Held in the City&rdquo; is facially constitutional.&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em> </em>She noted that the ordinance does not empower the city to pick and choose which groups and individuals get to engage in First Amendment activity, but provides the city with tools to set safe conditions for all those who engage in First Amendment activity, regardless of their views.&nbsp; If implemented consistently with the terms of the ordinance, content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations can be speech-enhancing by reducing the potential for violence during public demonstrations and protests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>&nbsp;APPLICATION PROCESS RE-OPENS FOR MARATHON PRODUCER</strong></p>
<p class=""content-left""><strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the applicants for producing next year&rsquo;s marathon in Portland were strong, the City is looking for a bolder vision - one that reflects a world class event that will showcase all that Portland has to offer. The City decided to revise some of the constraints and reopen the application process. Our marathon is more than just a running event. It&rsquo;s a beloved yearly tradition that brings in friends and family from all over the world to one of the most popular tourist cities in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a rare opportunity to start over again and design a marathon that evolves and elevates this long-standing Portland tradition. I, along with Commissioner Eudaly, are calling for event producers to submit their RFI&rsquo;s (Request for Information) to PBOT starting today&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Alliance commends Mayor Wheeler and Commissioner Eudaly for seeking an operator to lead a successful marathon year after year. A marathon in Portland with bold vision will bolster local businesses by attracting national and international competitors, along with spectators that can patronize our prized restaurants, accommodations, and diverse shopping experiences. The selected applicant should have strong financial management, internal and external oversight mechanisms, a comprehensive staffing model, robust volunteer program and extensive experience in athletic event management, as well as a familiarity with our unique and diverse communities.&rdquo; Andrew Hoan, President &amp; CEO, Portland Business Alliance</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing a variety of ideas, one that leverages our community&rsquo;s global reputation as a destination city for runners.</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>December 4, 2018</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Introduces Four Notable Items in City Council This Week</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>This week&rsquo;s agenda includes PS3&rsquo;s, affordable housing and plastics reduction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Item 1251: Public Safety Support Specialists (PS3s)</strong></p>
<p>Functionally, this ordinance would ratify a tentative agreement with the Portland Police Association, ultimately clearing the path for the Portland Police Bureau to post the position.</p>
<p>The vision of the PS3s is a part of the Mayor&rsquo;s vision around community policing. Fundamentally, PS3s will assist PPB in responding to non-emergency calls that do not require police authority, such as responding to car theft or delivering food boxes to a family in need. Hiring more PS3s means that the City increases the bandwidth of officers to engage the community and more time to do more than run from call to call.</p>

<p><a href=""/auditor/article/704990""><strong>Item 1246:</strong></a><strong> Affordable Housing</strong></p>
<p>This ordinance will fund construction of King Parks Apartments, a new affordable multifamily housing development located in the Interstate Corridor Urban Renewal Area, <strong>creating 70 additional units of affordable housing, mostly targeted for N/NE Preference Policy families. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The project focuses on households who are formerly homeless or at homelessness, as well as survivors of domestic violence.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Community conversations about reducing single-use plastics leads to unanimous vote on new ordinance</strong></p>
<p><em></em><em>Portland City Council passes ordinance to cut back on single-use plastic serviceware while Portlanders who rely on items for healthcare situations can still obtain what they need</em></p>
<p>At&nbsp;today&rsquo;s second reading and unanimous vote, Portland City Council unanimously passed a new ordinance to reduce the automatic distribution of single-use plastics in Portland, Oregon. Since Portland already has bans in place for Styrofoam and plastic grocery bags, the new ordinance repeals the existing code&nbsp;for Single-use Plastic Checkout Bags and Polystyrene Foam Food Containers and replaces it&nbsp;with Code Prohibitions and Restrictions on Single-use Plastic (Ordinance; replace Code Chapter 17.103; repeal Code Sections 17.102.300-340).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides overwhelming our landfills, plastic straws and other single-use disposables affect the health of humans and animal communities. Over 660 species, including sea turtles, whales, dolphins and seabirds, are impacted and in many cases die from ingesting or becoming entangled in the plastic debris,&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;A lot of people feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the plastic problem. This is a small but important step in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability (BPS) worked with the Mayor&rsquo;s office to research the policies of other cities, conduct a series of workgroup meetings, analyze community feedback and land on a policy recommendation: Restrictions on plastic serviceware including; straws, stirrers, utensils and condiment packaging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ordinance will multiply the impact we&rsquo;ve seen with our grassroots #DitchTheStrawPDX program, preventing millions of single-use items from entering the waste-stream, said Nancy Nordman, Ditch the Straw coordinator of the Portland chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. &ldquo;We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with businesses and the city to implement this policy, ultimately making a measurable reduction in waste and stopping plastic pollution at its source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ordinance will include the restrictions on plastic serviceware (defined as straws, stirrers, utensils and condiment packaging) for the following situations, when applicable to the food and beverage order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By request policy:</strong> In dine-in situations, plastic serviceware will be only available by request of the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Ask first policy:</strong> In fast food, take-out and delivery situations, plastic serviceware will only be provided after the customer has been asked and confirms they want the plastic serviceware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notification and outreach to businesses will begin in January 2019 and the ordinance will go into effect on July 1,2019.</p>
<p><strong>Community feedback guided policy development</strong></p>
<p>The work group, consisting of restaurants, wholesalers, a medical facility, American Disability Act (ADA) straw users, and environmental advocates, contributed their time to discussing plastics reduction at a series of meetings, along with partners from Multnomah County, Prosper Portland and the City of Portland Bureau of Equity and Human Rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mayor and taskforce embraced the need to create an inclusive policy that balanced the needs of both people living with disabilities and the environment,&rdquo; said Nickole Cheron, ADA title II and disability equity manager, City of Portland Office of Equity and Human Rights. &ldquo;We must continue to always ask ourselves who is the most impacted by our decisions and make sure we bring them to the table to insure an equitable path forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland restaurant community appreciates the city keeping the ordinance 'by-request,' respecting the need for single-use plastics for our customers, especially those in the disabled community,"" says Greg Astley, Director&nbsp;of Government Affairs, Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association.&nbsp;""Portland restaurants recognize the need to reduce plastics in the waste stream balanced with the needs of our guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A public survey focused on City action to reduce single-use plastics. Over 4000 responses resulted from the survey and were overwhelmingly supportive of City action to reduce single-use plastics.</p>
<p>The results of stakeholder engagement and the survey highlighted these focus areas.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The community sees the need for government intervention.</li>
<li>Waste <em>prevention</em> (not using) is the highest and best available alternative to single-use plastics.</li>
<li>Plastic straws are a crucial tool for people with disabilities and those recovering from injury or illness and therefore should be restricted, but not banned.</li>
<li>Alternatives for reuse and single-use plastic were not specified due to variabilities in environmental impact. Switching to paper may reduce marine impact but result in cutting down more trees and higher carbon emissions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Human health impacts from single-use plastics, including toxicity need to be considered.&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong><br /><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />12/13/2018<br />Contact: Eileen Park, (503) 823-6541<br />Eileen.park@portlandoregon.gov</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>City of Portland Commits to Clean Air Construction Standard</strong></p>
<p>Portland, OR -- Today, the City of Portland committed to reducing diesel emissions on public sector construction sites. Multnomah County is also expected to adopt the Standard later this month by executive order.</p>
<p>The Portland City Council voted unanimously to adopt an amendment to the City&rsquo;s Sustainable Procurement Policy, which would phase-in requirements for contractors working on City construction projects, with contract values over $1 million, to meet engine standards that will reduce emissions of diesel particulate matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased the City of Portland and Multnomah County are working together to provide leadership on a regional approach,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said. &ldquo;A regional commitment will help ensure that the impacts of this go far beyond City and County projects and it provides the necessary certainty for our contracting community. This approach will also help to alleviate some of the impact to people of color and low-income populations, who experience the effects of diesel pollution at a disproportionate rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chair Kafoury is scheduled to pass an executive order requiring the same Clean Air Construction Standard for all County construction projects later in December. &ldquo;This is a market-based approach,'' Chair Deborah Kafoury said. ""We're using the spending power of public construction projects to move the market toward clean equipment. And we're excited because it can be expanded beyond the City and County toward a regional solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The Standard requires equipment used on City and County construction projects to dramatically reduce particulate matter emissions from older diesel engines. The requirements will apply to non-road diesel equipment with equal to or greater than 25 horsepower, and on-road dump and cement trucks. It will include a phase-in period to allow contractors the time and flexibility to plan for the new standard. The City and County are also pursuing funding options to help disadvantaged, minority, women-owned and emerging small businesses upgrade their equipment to comply with the standard.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Portland and Multnomah County residents have the highest exposure to air toxics in the state and are well above national averages for cancer risk and respiratory hazards from air toxics. Diesel particulate matter from older engines is among the most prevalent and harmful airborne toxins in the region. According to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Portland Metro area registers diesel particulate matter (PM) levels above the ambient benchmark concentration set by the state.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The City and County worked with a coalition of local jurisdictions to develop this Standard with the intent that as multiple agencies adopt the Standard, it will foster a growing market for clean air construction equipment and improve air quality at a regional level. The coalition includes Washington and Clackamas Counties, the Port of Portland, Metro and the Department of Environmental Quality.</p>

<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong><br /><strong>MAYOR TED WHEELER</strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />1/10/2019<br />Contact: Eileen Park, (503) 823-6541<br />Eileen.park@portlandoregon.gov</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler and Chair Kafoury Announce Innovative Supportive Housing Pilot</strong><br /><em>State and local agencies pair funding for housing and services for the first time in a targeted effort to innovate solutions to chronic homelessness.</em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, ORE (January 10, 2019) &ndash; The Portland Housing Bureau (PHB), the Joint Office of Homeless Services, Multnomah County Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services, and Oregon Housing and Community Services, have awarded more than $12 million to two projects that will combine new housing and mental health services in a targeted effort to combat chronic homelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This innovative pilot is the first of its kind&mdash;leveraging state, county and city partnerships in a targeted effort to better use our dollars to address chronic homelessness, with an emphasis on providing crucial mental health services&rdquo; says Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;Homelessness is a national humanitarian crisis. It will take more than cities&mdash;but regional, state-wide and federal partnerships to solve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PHB&rsquo;s Notice of Funding Availability, released this summer, called for innovative, cost-effective proposals to create new Supportive Housing for homeless individuals experiencing mental illness, with a focus on updating the Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) housing model. The funding opportunity marks the first time capital funding to build affordable housing has been bundled with funding for the services vulnerable residents need to thrive in that housing.</p>
<p>Two projects have been awarded the funding, the agencies announced today. Combined, the projects will create a total of 98 units &ndash; nearly double the 50 originally envisioned in the solicitation. Seventy-eight of the new units will provide Supportive Housing.</p>
<p>The Division Street Apartments, proposed by Central City Concern and Related Northwest, will provide 40 SRO units of Permanent Supportive Housing and 20 studios, with 40 of the units reserved for extremely low-income individuals experiencing mental illness, including severe mental illness. Central City Concern will be the service provider.</p>
<p>Findley Commons, proposed by Do Good Multnomah and HomeFirst Development, will redevelop an underutilized parking lot at St. Mark&rsquo;s Lutheran Church on SE Powell Blvd to create 38 units of housing focusing on underserved Veterans, including Veterans of color, women, and extremely-low income Veterans. In this model, SRO units would serve to stabilize Veterans, who could eventually transition into the larger units.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people need more than an apartment key to rebuild their lives. They also need treatment and services,&rdquo; says Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury. &ldquo;For those neighbors, the only answer to homelessness is a home of their own with the right support. This is exactly what these projects represent because everybody needs privacy and a place to call home when working through a crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expanding Permanent Supportive Housing over the coming decade by roughly 200 units a year is a critical element of the local strategy to address chronic homelessness. Permanent Supportive Housing combines accessible, affordable housing and the supportive services, including mental health and addiction services.</p>
<p>In addition, Findley Commons will serve as a demonstration project for a new subsidy model combining unsubsidized units and Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers. It also models how the city&rsquo;s faith communities can assist in the local homeless effort by making their excess land available for affordable housing development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The benefits of permanent supportive housing are well documented, and this is a proven strategy we will implement statewide,&rdquo; said Margaret Salazar, Director of Oregon Housing and Community Services. &ldquo;Oregon Housing and Community Services is thrilled to contribute $2 million to the City of Portland and Multnomah County&rsquo;s efforts to increase supportive housing and address homelessness and housing instability for Oregon&rsquo;s most vulnerable community members.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day after Christmas, Colin O&rsquo;Brady, 33, accomplished what many believed was impossible. He became the first person to trek across Antarctica solo and unaided by kites or resupplies. The 900+ mile transcontinental journey took O&rsquo;Brady nearly two months to finish. He endured raging winds, polar temperatures, and sleepless nights. O&rsquo;Brady made history with his extraordinary display of endurance and skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Colin a number of years ago before he headed off on his Seven Summits record quest. He&rsquo;s not only a friend but someone I greatly admire. We&rsquo;ve bonded over our mutual passion for endurance sports and climbing Everest. I am thrilled to have the honor of welcoming him home with the Oregon Historical Society,&rdquo; says Mayor Ted Wheeler</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler and the Oregon Historical Society will be hosting Colin O&rsquo;Brady on Tuesday for a conversation with the public. Before the event starts at 5:30 pm, we will be holding a press conference for the media.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Announces Brooksee as New Marathon Producer</strong></p>
<p>We are proud to announce that Brooksee will be the new organizer for a marathon in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My vision for a marathon is one that is a world-class event worthy of a host city that&rsquo;s known for running &ndash; but also for a marathon that highlights the entire community and increases opportunities for community participation and equal economic prosperity,&rdquo; says Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;I believe in Brooksee&rsquo;s vision for community and desire to highlight the best Portland has to offer, and I could not be more excited to award them the marathon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brooksee is well-known for producing large-scale running events around the country. Their goal is to attract 20,000 runners by 2023 and 35,000 runners by 2030. They want to create an event that showcases Portland as a premiere destination that captures both the city&rsquo;s natural beauty and unique culture. But they also want to create a race that will reinvest in Portland, with a particular emphasis on underserved communities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of my organization, I express our sincere gratitude to the City of Portland for entrusting us with the reins of this historic event. We look forward to working with elected officials, city staff, community organizations, and Portland's residents to create the most iconic and unique race in the world,&rdquo; says Brooksee CEO Jared Rohatinsky. &ldquo;We pledge the entirety of our resources to the ultimate goal of serving Portland. We warmly invite the Portland community to unite with us in the creation of this event. We have an open-door policy and will gladly accept and implement suggestions from all stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brooksee plans to create a Marathon Community Council to ensure the event meets the needs and interests of the community. They&rsquo;re already working with local partners like Travel Portland and local hotels. A key component of Brooksee&rsquo;s vision is a running route that includes as many of Portland&rsquo;s unique neighborhoods as possible. Additionally, Paula Harkin, who ran Portland&rsquo;s 2018 Marathon, will join Brooksee&rsquo;s staff as the race&rsquo;s Local Liaison and Director of Community Outreach.</p>
<p>Brooksee was the highest-scoring respondent in the City&rsquo;s original RFP, but made their proposal even stronger for the re-issued RFP because of this strong vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We applaud the City for revisiting the RFP to emphasize the importance of equity, inclusion, and a bolder vision for what the event should accomplish in Portland. We view the edits and additions in the new RFP as perfect complements to our vision and strategy and feel that they do justice to the potential of this event. Portland deserves an event that delivers these additional components.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The City of Portland stands with Portlanders experiencing hardships as a result of the unprecedented federal shutdown.</p>

<p>Portland Water and the Bureau of Environmental Services offer flexible payment arrangements and other options for those having a hard time paying their sewer, stormwater, and water bill. The utility bureaus are here to assist all our customers in need.&nbsp;Financial assistance in the form of payment arrangements, crisis vouchers, and the Utility Safety Net program are available to those federal employees and other customers experiencing hardships.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">&ldquo;Those harmed by the shutdown are our neighbors. Many have not yet received backpay, so we hope these services will help,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand that some people are facing difficult decisions resulting from this unprecedented government shutdown that this can strain household budgets for weeks and months ahead,&rdquo; said Water Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The Portland utility bureaus have multiple ways to help customers endure times of hardship.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Portland City Council Introduces Resolution Condemning White Supremacy and Alt-Right Hate Groups</strong></p>
<p>Portland, OR&mdash;Mayor Wheeler and Commissioners Eudaly, Fish, Fritz and Hardesty will introduce a resolution this afternoon to condemn white supremacy and alt-right groups in Portland, and for the City of Portland to work with community organizations to develop city-wide training on the history and impact of white supremacy, and how to identify white supremacy.</p>
<p>In 2018, every extremist murder had ties to far-right extremism. According to the Anti-Defamation League, last year was the fourth deadliest year for domestic extremist violence since 1970. Additionally, Portland has a documented history of white supremacist hate groups who have used intimidation and have committed violent repression of individuals in Portland. There&rsquo;s also been a recent surge of alt-right hate group activity and hostility, which conjures painful memories of the City's past and causes harm to current residents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White supremacy is fed by silence and complacency. This is a fundamental recognition that we have to prioritize these issues because our demographic and history skew towards disenfranchising and disempowering communities of color that have been unable to benefit from the City&rsquo;s progress,&rdquo; says Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;This is not a silver bullet, but I&rsquo;m hopeful this resolution is the start to meaningful action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the City of Portland and the State of Oregon have racist governing histories, including Oregon entering the Union as a ""whites-only"" state,"" the state&rsquo;s refusal to ratify the 14th and 15th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and enacting black exclusion laws. In Portland, racist governing policies have created disparities due to redlining, the displacement of black communities through the construction of Interstate 5 and other projects, the failure to protect and preserve Vanport, and a history of bias in government services, including policing, all of which have led to the gentrification and decimation of historically black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This resolution lays the foundation for the City of Portland to partner with local organizations and community leaders in a collective effort to combat white supremacy.</p>
<p>Portland nonprofits CAIR-Oregon, the Oregon Justice Resource Center and the Western States Center are supportive of the resolution, and will propose six action items for the City to address activity of white nationalist and alt-right groups in Portland. They will hold a press conference on Thursday, Feb. 7 at 4:30 pm at the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education, 724 NW Davis St. Representatives of the organizations will make short statements in support of the resolution and outline ideas for ways the City can address this problem.</p>
<p>The resolution is part of a broader effort to ensure access and inclusivity for all Portlanders, and more specifically tailored to the growing threat of white supremacy in the community. With this resolution, the City is signaling its commitment to partnering with community organizations to denounce white supremacy and live up to the City&rsquo;s values as a welcoming and inclusive city for all Portlanders.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>MAYOR WHEELER STATEMENT ON PPB TEXT MESSAGES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The released text messages, which I learned about in <em><a href=""https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2019/02/14/texts-between-portland-police-and-patriot-prayer-ringleader-joey-gibson-show-warm-exchange/"">Willamette Week</a></em>, are disturbing.</p>
<p>Community members have long expressed concerns about police bias during demonstrations. Incidents like this contribute to the distrust that so many people have about the Portland Police Bureau. This creates a mandate for specific training to identify and combat white supremacy. It is imperative for law enforcement to remain objective and professional, and in my opinion, these text messages appear to cross several boundaries. They also raise questions about whether warrants are being enforced consistently and what information is being shared with individuals who may be subject to arrest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the texts appear to unnecessarily encourage Joey Gibson, the leader of a group that perpetrates hate speech and violence. Demonstrations that he has led have caused significant disruption and increased fear in our community. I have directed Chief Outlaw to do a thorough investigation of this matter and report back to me expeditiously.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/712829

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Statement From Mayor Wheeler On Training &amp; Independent Investigation</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;First and foremost: Chief Outlaw and I are going to implement training for the Portland Police Bureau around how to identify white supremacy based on the recommendation of the Oregon Justice Resource Center, Council on American-Islamic Relations Oregon and the Western States Center.</p>
<p>Second: I will order an independent investigation to review the existence of bias in the actions of the PPB leading up to and during demonstrations involving alt-right and anti-fascist protesters. Chief Outlaw agrees this is a necessary next step and is more than ready to work with me on this. I have heard from the people of Portland. I agree we must do more to ensure that we adhere to the values affirmed by the resolution recently passed by City Council to condemn white supremacist and alt-right hate groups. I&rsquo;ll be working with Chief Outlaw and community organizations in the days to come to solidify details.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Selects Andrea Durbin As New Director of the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler is proud to select Andrea Durbin as the new Director of the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. After a thorough and inclusive selection process involving multiple internal and external stakeholders to define imperative experience and attributes, the choice became clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrea brings over 20 years of effective environmental policy leadership in Portland and beyond,&rdquo; says Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Her leadership as the Oregon Environmental Council&rsquo;s Executive Director resulted in real progress as we fight to combat the realities of climate change. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing all that BPS will accomplish under her leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited by the opportunity to lead the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability for the City of Portland. We&rsquo;re at a pivotal point in this city. &nbsp;As the local economy and population grows, we know our livability, affordability and quality of life are challenged,&rdquo; says Durbin. &ldquo;I look forward to working with the Mayor, City Commissioners and the hard-working staff at BPS to help our city realize a healthier, more equitable and resilient community for all Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Durbin served as the Executive Director of Oregon Environmental Council since 2006. Prior to that, she worked in consulting, which allowed her to advise clients in the financial sector on the development of their environmental and social standards for international lending practices. She also worked as a National Campaign Director for Greenpeace and as International Program Director for Friends of the Earth.</p>
<p>Due to the enormous amount of time and effort that went into this selection, the bureau is getting an ideal and passionate leader, and the City will benefit for years to come. Durbin brings a collaborative and equity-centered approach to BPS, which aligns with the mission and values of the bureau. Her experience in advancing sound and effective environmental policy here in Oregon will be a welcome addition to the City of Portland&rsquo;s staff as we work collectively to meet the challenges posed by the reality of climate change.</p>
<p>Her first day will be Thursday, April 18.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Hires New Senior Public Safety Adviser</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler has hired Robert King as his new senior advisor on public safety issues.</p>
<p>After 27 years in the Portland Police Bureau, Robert King retired in 2018 as Commander of North Precinct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, King worked with community members and law enforcement colleagues to create a space for diverse groups of people to navigate their differences and find ways to work together.</p>
<p>King worked on a variety of assignments throughout his career including serving as a patrol officer, SERT officer, detective, patrol supervisor, and as PPA President. In his career, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Captain and then retired as a Commander of North Precinct. After an eight-month-long retirement, King returned to public service as a safety officer for the Bureau of Development Services.</p>
<p>King is committed to and supportive of the Mayor&rsquo;s goal of building trust between the community and the bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at a critical time when it comes to the role of public safety. As my administration continues to navigate how to evolve policing to be relevant to the changing needs of our community, I am pleased to have Robert King join the team. He brings many years of experience and insight that will be invaluable to my office. He also comes widely recommended from the community, having spent decades forging important relationships. Our police officers deserve the respect, attention, and resources they need now more than ever. I hope to continue building a strong relationship with the members of the Bureau and our community with the help and guidance of Robert King.&rdquo; Mayor Ted Wheeler</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thankful to Mayor Wheeler for this opportunity to serve the police bureau and community.&nbsp; I respect, admire, and appreciate the work done by members of the Portland Police Bureau.&nbsp; I am deeply committed to continuing the work of building bridges as well as finding ways to heal hurting communities. I look forward to working collaboratively with members of the bureau and the public I serve.&rdquo; Robert King</p>
<p>On a personal note, King is a proud husband and father to three children.</p>
<p>His first day will be Monday, April 8th.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Portland Community Insights Survey</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Community Insights Survey is the City&rsquo;s new comprehensive survey of the Portland community. By conducting this survey, the Mayor, Council, and City bureaus will gain actionable information about Portlanders&rsquo; priorities and how we can improve our programs. The survey is a redesign of the longstanding Auditor&rsquo;s Community Survey and is being implemented by the City Budget Office. The survey will be open to the entire Portland community from <strong>May 8<sup>th</sup>- May 28<sup>th</sup>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This year, the Community Insights Survey will be deployed with an entirely new approach. </strong>It is an online survey that any Portlander is invited to take. We will also bring the survey directly into Portland communities with the help of a multi-lingual crew of 40 canvassers (Community Data Fellows). The Fellows include students from Portland State University (PSU), Portland Community College (PCC), and local community leaders. After participating in a training workshop on data equity, the Community Data Fellows are administering the survey at community centers, special events, and gathering places throughout the city during May.</p>
<p><strong>The survey is designed to ensure the diverse perspectives of all Portland communities are represented in the City&rsquo;s budgeting and policy process. </strong>The survey will be disseminated through community-based networks and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Russian. In addition, our canvassing strategy will ensure harder-to-reach populations are heard. Analysis of the survey results based on meaningful community identities and characteristics will illuminate areas where the City can better serve Portlanders and advance Portland&rsquo;s racial equity goals.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>The survey results will provide City Bureaus and City Council with actionable insights to inform budgets and policies.</strong>&nbsp; New survey questions on today&rsquo;s most pressing local issues will provide data on Portlanders&rsquo; policy and budget priorities, satisfaction with services, ideas for improvement, and service usage patterns. Responses will fuel evidence-based decision-making, address important citywide issues, and capture hard-to-measure outcomes. After the results are analyzed, the data will be used to inform citywide and bureau-specific strategic planning efforts and programmatic decisions by both City Bureaus and City Council. Findings from the survey will also be reported out to the Portland community.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong><em>2019 Portland Community Insights Survey &ndash; Open Until May 28<sup>th</sup>, 2019.</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><em>&ldquo;Portland has become a city of many cultures. We have embraced and thrived from the richness of immigrants and locals. To move forward it&rsquo;s important to hear from all walks of life in this City. This citywide survey is an opportunity for all communities to have their voices heard in regards to their needs,&rdquo; said Ping Khaw.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">Khaw is the Project Manager for the <a href=""/civic/article/482264"">Community Engagement Liaison Services</a>, a program through the City of Portland that trains civic activists who are available to assist City public involvement program with interpretation and facilitation services. Khaw was hired as the Canvassing Coordinator for the City&rsquo;s 2019 Portland Community Insights Survey. She manages a team of approximately 40 community-based canvassers who are bringing the Portland Community Insights Survey into the field.</p>

The survey is a redesign of the longstanding Auditor&rsquo;s Community Survey and is being implemented by the City Budget Office. The survey is open to the entire Portland community until May 28<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>The canvassers are part of the City&rsquo;s Community Data Fellowship program and include students from Portland State University (PSU), Portland Community College (PCC), and local community leaders. After participating in a training workshop on data in local government, best canvassing practices, and data equity, the Community Data Fellows have been administering the survey at community centers, special events, and gathering places throughout the City during May. The Fellows have canvassed at locations such as the Rainbow Night Market, Filipino Night at Portland State University, Black Community of Portland meetings, the Native America Youth and Family Center (NAYA) market, and the City Council Budget Forum on the Mayor&rsquo;s Proposed Budget, among others.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud that the City is committed to magnifying the voices of some of our most vulnerable and underrepresented communities. It makes me hopeful that Portland is further engaging with the diverse experiences and voices that need to be heard and fostering a more representative city for all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><em>said John Hernandez, one of the Community Data Fellows working on this initiative.</em></p>
<p>Another Fellow, Karah Grossman, stressed the importance of these types of surveys, &ldquo;It might seem that our society is inundated by surveys. We see them all throughout social media, in print, and even as part of our market process, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen surveys work. They give people the power to influence things that seem so much bigger than themselves, and that is why they are so important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The survey will remain open for any Portlander to take until May 28<sup>th</sup>. It is translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Russian. After the results are analyzed, the data will be used to inform citywide and bureau-specific strategic planning efforts and programmatic decisions by City bureaus and City Council. Findings from the survey will also be reported out to the Portland community.</p>

<p>DHM research completed a formal community survey on behalf of the City of Portland, Compliance Officer Community Liaison (COCL) and the Portland Committee on Community Engagement Policing (PCCEP).</p>
<p>This was a requirement of the City&rsquo;s Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s sample was based on a random selection of all Portland residential mailing addresses. 6500 households were selected to participate. A total of 1380 valid surveys were returned.</p>
<p>Key findings via DHM Research:</p>
<p>1. Portland residents view the Portland Police Bureau most positively when it comes to activities directly related to fighting crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Residents rated PPB&rsquo;s performance lowest on PPB&rsquo;s response to mental health crises in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Of those who had contact with the police, the majority report they were treated fairly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Residents expressed concern that PPB use more force than necessary when dealing with communities of color and those experiencing a mental health crisis.</p>
<p>5. Residents from historically marginalized communities express greater concern about how PPB officers treat them.</p>
<p>6. Residents are unsure whether the PPB is taking steps to improve services.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Wheeler Hires New Deputy Chief of Staff</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Mayor Ted Wheeler is pleased to announce the hire of Jamal Fox as the Mayor&rsquo;s new Deputy Chief of Staff. Fox comes with a wealth of experience in local government, most recently serving as the Property &amp; Business Development Manager for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.</p>
<p>At the age of 25, Fox was elected to the Greensboro City Council in North Carolina as the youngest ever to be elected. He was later re-elected and served until 2017. He then moved to Portland with his family.</p>
<p><em>""I am looking forward to being a part of a strong and high performing team of professionals. It is an honor and privilege to serve the Portland community through the Mayor&rsquo;s Office. I have many goals, but one of my top priorities is to ensure that the values and policies championed by Mayor Ted Wheeler and his team will have a lasting legacy in Portland - values rooted in equity and economic prosperity for all, where Portlanders will experience the benefits of the work we do now for generations to come. I look forward to working with the Mayor&rsquo;s Team, Council Offices, and the community, as we come together to overcome the challenges of our time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Jamal Fox</em></p>
<p>Before being elected, Fox worked for the City of Greensboro in the City Manager&rsquo;s Office and the Department of Planning and Community Development and is also a former North Carolina A&amp;T State University Political Science Adjunct Professor.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased to welcome Jamal Fox to the team. His extensive experience as a former elected leader, educator, and as a community advocate will be invaluable to our team. I look forward to his leadership as we continue to work hard for all Portlanders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Mayor Ted Wheeler</em></p>
<p>On a personal note, Fox is a proud husband and a new father. His first day will be July 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019.</p>
<p>He takes over the role left vacant after the Mayor promoted his then Deputy Chief of Staff, Kristin Dennis, to Chief of Staff earlier this year.</p>

<p>The City selected the National Police Foundation to conduct an independent assessment of the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s response to mass demonstrations and First Amendment Assemblies after Mayor Wheeler called for an independent investigation reviewing PPB&rsquo;s actions leading up to and during demonstrations involving alt-right and anti-fascist protestors. The assessment will include PPB communications with protestors.</p>
<p>The goals of the assessment are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;To independently assess PPB&rsquo;s response to demonstrations on June 4, 2017 and August 4, 2018 and other relevant incidents from a variety of perspectives that include PPB personnel, community groups and members, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Conduct analysis of where improvements can be made in PPB policy, planning, practice, training, tactics, staffing, and resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify ways to strengthen communication and relationship building with community members and demonstrators.</p>
<p>The City chose the National Police Foundation because they had the most comprehensive proposal, along with the strongest team. They&rsquo;ve also conducted similar work in the past.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>With a Decade of Success, SummerWorks Strengthens Region&rsquo;s Workforce</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>&ldquo;We are very proud of SummerWorks and what it brings to the City, as well as the support we have seen from the business community. This is truly a win-win investment. </em><em>For every $1.00 invested in SummerWorks, SummerWorks participants earn $1.90 in wages. They learn what it takes to be successful at work and improve the quality of available talent for local employers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Mayor Ted Wheeler</em></p>
<p>As SummerWorks enters its tenth year of placing Portland-area young adults in summer jobs and internships, a recent study conducted by EcoNW shows that program participants achieve greater academic and workforce success.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009 in response to the youth unemployment crisis caused by the Great Recession, &nbsp;<a href=""http://summerworkspdx.org/"">SummerWorks</a>&nbsp; has placed over 7,000 young people, ages 16 to 24, in summer jobs.</p>
<p>Despite the economic turnaround, regional youth continue to face significant challenges. Youth unemployment in the County remains stubbornly high at nearly 13%. More than 10,000 young people between the ages of 16-24 in Multnomah County are neither connected to school or work. More than 20% of PPS students do not graduate from high school in 4 years and this number is significantly higher for low-income students and young people of color.</p>
<p>SummerWorks helps bridge the economic and academic divide by providing a first job experience for young adults who are motivated to work but lack the&nbsp;social networks or support to find jobs on their own. The program targets under-represented youth who face challenges such as growing up in poverty or being at-risk of dropping out of high school, and places participants into meaningful work opportunities they likely would not have had access to without the program. In addition, SummerWorks provides work readiness training, job coaching and other support services to promote program success and encourage ongoing engagement in school and work.</p>
<p>The EcoNW report summarizes findings from an assessment of SummerWorks participation between 2009 &ndash; 2016. The analysis showed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;SummerWorks participants had better than predicted academic outcomes, especially among participants from communities of color.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;SummerWorks enrolls a much higher share of people of color than the region overall &ndash; 71 percent of participants identified as a person of color compared to 41 percent of all students in Multnomah and Washington counties.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;High school youth returned to school at higher rates than expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;SummerWorks participants enrolled in postsecondary programs at a much higher rate than their peers (65% vs 52%).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;70 percent of high school graduates and 72 percent of non-graduates either continued their education or engaged in work the year following participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;High school students age 16 through 18 who returned to school and worked in the year following participation had higher median wages than their non-participant peers across the Portland metro region ($8,404 vs $2,105).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of the SummerWorks program shows that a long-term commitment to workforce development has greater impacts to our community than just summer jobs,&rdquo; says Andrew McGough, Executive Director of Worksystems, Inc. &ldquo;Engaging young adults in programs that increase their participation in school and earning potential helps create a stronger economy for the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Initial funding for SummerWorks came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009. Since then, more than 40 investors have contributed to the program&rsquo;s success, the largest being the <strong><em>City of Portland </em></strong>and Multnomah County. Other investors include, the Department of Human Services, Washington County, Tri-Met, JP Morgan Chase and several other regional companies.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler and Portland City Council to Host Public Community Forum on Zenith</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler and the Portland City Council will host a public community forum intended to discuss issues related to the activity at the Zenith terminal in North Portland on <strong>July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portlanders have every right to be concerned about the domestic and international shipment of crude and tar sands oil,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;I am proud to serve as Mayor of a city that has a long history of environmentalism. I remain opposed to any expansion or activity that would endanger the health and safety of communities in this city - and pose a serious threat to our natural environment. I look forward to engaging in meaningful discussion with Portlanders about steps we can take together to ensure this goal is met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City&rsquo;s ability to regulate oil trains and Zenith&rsquo;s activities is limited, but we should leave no stone unturned in finding ways to protect Portlanders. From extraction, to transport, to refinement, tar sands oil is the dirtiest and most dangerous form of fossil fuel. We don&rsquo;t need it and we don&rsquo;t want it in Portland or anywhere on our planet&rdquo; said Commissioner Chloe Eudaly.</p>
<p>This is a time for the public to express their concerns. It&rsquo;s also a time for the City to share what actions have been taken so far, where we stand, and discuss next steps.</p>
<p>The Zenith Community Forum is scheduled for <strong>Monday, July 15<sup>th</sup>, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM at the University of Portland&rsquo;s Buckley Auditorium.</strong></p>
<p>The event is open to the public and media.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Appoints New City Budget Director</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler has appointed Jessica Kinard to be the next director of Portland&rsquo;s Budget Office. Kinard has served as Interim City Budget Director since October 2018, and replaces Andrew Scott who left the city in June 2018. She will lead a 16-person team focused on managing the budget process, supporting Council budget decision-making and providing unfiltered information and analysis to elected officials, bureaus and the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During her time as Interim Budget Director, Jessica has proven her ability as a strong and effective leader,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;We are confident she will provide the robust oversight and guidance needed to ensure sound fiscal management and decision-making by the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinard joined the City Budget Office as a Principal Financial Analyst in 2015. She came to Portland from the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Public Policy and Finance in San Francisco where she served under the late Mayor Ed Lee, helping to balance the City and County&rsquo;s then $8+ billion budget. She helped develop and advise on budget and policy issues across a range of topics, with a focus on human services, aging and adult services and children&rsquo;s programming and policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During this time of immense growth and change that we are experiencing as Portlanders, it is imperative that we ensure our budgeting and financial practices are responsible, effective, equitable and transparent,&rdquo; said Kinard. &ldquo;I am honored for this opportunity, and I look forward to supporting budget decision-making and leading budget processes that are effective and efficient in order to meet the many current and future mandates of our communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before beginning her career in city government, Kinard worked in the non-profit sector.

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Appoints Interim Director For The Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Youth Violence Prevention</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler has appointed Tom Peavey as Interim Director of the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Youth Violence Prevention (OYVP). Peavey&mdash;most recently Policy Manager for the OYVP&mdash;steps in for Antoinette Edwards who retired after serving for ten years as director for the OYVP. The office works with the Mayor, the police and other city bureaus, the county, state and federal services, businesses, schools and the faith community to help reduce violence and to offer support for victims of violence.</p>
<p>Peavey has a long history of serving Portland communities. He was a member of the Portland Police Bureau for 31 years (1973-2004), serving as a 4-year member of the Mounted Patrol Unit as well as on Portland&rsquo;s first Neighborhood Response Team pilot program. In 2006, he transitioned into the OYVP where he was awarded for his work by a local faith-based organization engaged in several community problem-solving and mentoring projects. He has also served as the secretary for the agency&rsquo;s Community Peace Collaborative Public Forum since the forum&rsquo;s creation in 2014.</p>
<p>On a personal note, Peavey, who lives with his wife of 36 years, is a father of two and grandfather of five. He&rsquo;s been deeply involved in area youth sports as a coach and mentor since the 1990s. He will serve as Interim Director while the Mayor&rsquo;s Office completes the process of finding a full-time replacement for Edwards.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler Joins 230+ Mayors Calling on the Senate to Act on Bipartisan Gun Safety Legislation</strong></p>
<p>Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has signed a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors that calls for immediate action by the U.S. Senate on bipartisan gun legislation that has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Mayor Wheeler joins 230+ mayors nationwide in signing the letter, that has been sent to all members of the Senate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to work together to make our cities and countries safer,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;Already in 2019, there have over 250 mass shootings. The recent tragic events in El Paso and Dayton are just reminders that we need Washington to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter, addressed specifically to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, urges the leaders to call the Senate back to session to take up and pass bills that would strengthen the background check system.

<p class=""content-center""><strong>City Set to Exceed Housing Bond Goals with Slate of New Projects </strong><em></em></p>
<p>PORTLAND, ORE &ndash; Mayor Wheeler and the Portland Housing Bureau unveiled nine new Bond projects today, coupled with the announcement that the number of new units moving into development now meet&mdash;and in some cases exceed&mdash;all of the goals set forth under Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2016, voters approved the bond measure dedicating $258.4 million to create 1,300 units of permanently affordable housing. The nine projects announced today join two other projects that are already open and one currently in development for a total of 1,424 units of bond-funded housing complete or in progress across the city &ndash; exceeding the overall goal for the funding by more than 100 units.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland voters passed our city&rsquo;s first-ever affordable housing bond because, as Portlanders, we share the belief that we all deserve a healthy, safe and affordable place to live and to call home,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;Meeting these goals and delivering on our promise to voters reflects our collective resolve and commitment to addressing the needs of Portlanders most impacted by the housing affordability crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the addition of these projects to the pipeline, the City is also set to meet or exceed its commitments to ensure that 650 of the units would provide family-size housing, 600 would be affordable to households below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI), and 300 would provide Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals and those with disabilities.</p>
<p>The new projects were selected through the Bond Opportunity Solicitation (BOS), released by the Housing Bureau in April. Utilizing new authority to leverage public-private partnerships from a 2018 constitutional amendment, the BOS marked the first time private and non-profit entities have had the opportunity to bid for project funding from Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond.</p>
<p>The total funding awarded from the BOS includes $115.3 million from Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond, as well as $4 million from Multnomah County. Home Forward additionally committed rent support for more than 250 of the new units. In partnership with the Joint Office of Homeless Services, the County will also be committing funding for services to support the community-wide effort to create more Permanent Supportive Housing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud that we&rsquo;re prioritizing our dollars from as many sources we can. Our goal is to permanently end someone&rsquo;s homelessness and fulfill our promise on supportive housing,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Chair Deborah Kafoury.&nbsp;&ldquo;Housing is the only real answer. It&rsquo;s as true for a family struggling to make rent, as it is for someone struggling outside with an addiction. A home that&rsquo;s affordable, with the right support, is how we break the cycle of addiction.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The new projects will add approximately 930 units of affordable housing, including 443 at 30% AMI, 329 units of family-size housing, and 254 units of PSH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These 12 projects made possible so far by Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond represent over 2,900 Portlanders who will have the safety and security of a home they can afford,&rdquo; said Portland Housing Bureau Director Shannon Callahan. &ldquo;They are children who will have a stable place to grow up in a neighborhood that offers them opportunities, seniors on fixed incomes living with dignity and peace of mind, and our homeless neighbors getting a new start and a chance to live safely off the streets. Together with our partners, we are creating new housing across the city to serve and support the diverse needs of our community.&rdquo; <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Currently, approximately $45 million from the original $258.4 million remains unallocated for future investment.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Sept. 18, Andrea Durbin, Director at the City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, will be available from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. at City Hall for interviews to provide updates on initiatives and proposals that are in place to address the climate crisis locally.</p>
<p><strong>A Unified Approach to Equitable Climate Action</strong></p>
<p>With such a broad and diverse range of voices urging us to act, the City of Portland seeks to create a climate emergency declaration that brings Portlanders together to foster unity and inclusion, share resources, and prioritize critical next steps. Mayor Ted Wheeler has tasked the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability with collecting community feedback with an emphasis on hearing the perspectives of youth, communities of color and low-income populations. The Climate Emergency Declaration will be one of many actions that Portland City Council will take in the coming months to protect and enhance our home for present and future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Report on 2017 Carbon Emissions and Trends</strong></p>
<p>While the challenge of climate change is more urgent than ever, Portland&rsquo;s response is not new. Portland was the first city in the U.S. to adopt a climate action plan in 1993.&nbsp; The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability will release a report on the Multnomah County 2017 carbon emissions to give an update on local carbon reduction activities.</p>
<p>Despite 26 years of climate planning and mitigation, local carbon emission&nbsp;reductions in Portland and Multnomah County have plateaued at approximately 15%&nbsp;below 1990 levels.&nbsp;The reductions to date are impressive given population and economic growth since 1990 - 38%&nbsp;more people and 34%&nbsp;more jobs. Director Durbin will be available with Bureau staff to discuss key emission trends and citywide successes.</p>

<p class=""xmsonormal content-center""><em>Portland General Electric and TriMet join Mayor Wheeler in a public/private partnership to advance clean energy</em></p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">Mayor Ted Wheeler will join mayors from around the world as they gather alongside scientists, global community leaders and business executives at the <a href=""https://c40summit2019.org/"">2019 C40 World Mayors Summit</a> being held in Copenhagen, Denmark Oct. 9-12. Following the momentum from the Climate Strike last month, this gathering continues the global attention and urgency towards addressing the climate crisis. Attendees are convening to share ideas, lessons learned, launch new partnerships and promote creative urban solutions to curb climate change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Portland continues to be among those committed to&mdash;and leading action for&mdash;addressing the climate crisis. We were the first city in the U.S. to adopt a climate action plan in 1993 and we have been working to reduce carbon emissions ever since,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;The C40 Summit offers us the opportunity to learn from other innovating cities about new ways to reduce our carbon footprint and intensify local actions to address the climate emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler will also take the stage to share Portland&rsquo;s continuing strategy and efforts to become more resilient to the impacts of climate change and to cut carbon pollution, including recognition of the community-led initiative that established the Portland Clean Energy Fund. Leadership and action from the energy and transportation sector will play a major role in addressing the climate crisis, and Mayor Wheeler is grateful that leaders from PGE and TriMet have accepted his invitation to join the City of Portland at the C40 Summit to collaborate effectively, learn more about climate innovations in other cities and together drive more meaningful, measurable and bold action on climate change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TriMet stands in partnership with Mayor Wheeler and PGE to fight climate change, and we vow to work together to achieve the region&rsquo;s climate goals. Transit is part of the solution to our global climate crisis,&rdquo; TriMet General Manager Doug Kelsey said. &ldquo;It will take all of us doing big things, like converting to a non-diesel bus fleet, and the smallest of things, like taking one extra transit trip a week to make a difference. I look forward to hearing and sharing innovative ideas at the C40 World Mayors Summit that will help advance efforts to improve the health of our community and lessen our impact on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PGE is proud to join City of Portland and TriMet at the C40 Summit to collaborate globally with other thought leaders on strategies for delivering a clean energy future,&rdquo; said Maria Pope, President and CEO of Portland General Electric. &ldquo;United by a common purpose and a public/private partnership, we are committed to building affordable, resilient and clean energy communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To offset the impact of air travel by City of Portland delegates and support staff, the City has chosen to purchase carbon offsets from Port Blakely&rsquo;s Winston Creek Forest Project in Washington State. The City is purchasing the offsets from the Winston Creek project managed by the Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF). BEF is not for profit and sales of carbon offsets provide a source of revenue to support these programs rather than going to a bottom line.</p>
<p>Representing 700+ million people and one quarter of the global economy in an unprecedented gathering, mayors of the C40 cities are committed to delivering on the most ambitious goals for tackling climate change and taking immediate, inclusive climate action.</p>

<p>Friday, Oct. 4, <a href=""https://www.nwpilotproject.org/"">Northwest Pilot Project</a> (NWPP) will celebrate its <a href=""https://www.nwpilotproject.org/50th-anniversary-party/"">50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary</a> of providing affordable housing and services for low-income and very low-income seniors (55 and over) in Multnomah county. Mayor Ted Wheeler congratulates and thanks NWPP for providing their caring, compassionate and values-driven service to those most in need, most deserving and most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few organizations in Portland have had such a significant impact over such a long time as Northwest Pilot Project. 50 years is an incredibly long time for any organization to stay as vibrant and relevant as NWPP,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;Milestones like that are not achieved unless you&rsquo;re the best in class, and they&rsquo;re not achieved without devoted, diligent and steady leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NWPP helps stabilize the housing of about 600 seniors each year. They don&rsquo;t own or manage housing, instead they leverage their 50 years of relationships with landlords, property managers and community development partners to securing housing for those who are most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler will be on hand to personally honor and recognize NWPP for its valuable work in the community for the past 50 years and in the future.</p>

<p class=""xmsonormal content-center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Portland celebrates 60 years of sister city partnership with Sapporo and bolsters economic development with Japan</span></strong></p>
<p class=""xmsonormal content-center""><em>One of the oldest sister city partnerships in the country, City delegates will be joined by Royal Rosarians, Travel Portland, Portland-Sapporo Sister City Association and others in Japan</em></p>
<p class=""xmsonormal""><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler will be joining the Portland-Sapporo Sister City Association and other agencies in Japan to honor the 60th Anniversary of the relationship between Portland and Sapporo next week. Established in 1959 out of the shared desire for peace and productivity, the bond between Portland and Sapporo is one of the first sister city relationships to be established in the United States. The rich history and traditions shared by the two cities are the backbone of a <strong><em>successful international trade initiative</em></strong>. Earlier this year, Mayor Wheeler had the pleasure of hosting Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto and a delegation of 90 people from Sapporo while celebrating the 60th Anniversary on Portland soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;60 years together means 60 years of sharing economic prosperity, knowledge, earthquake resilience strategies and the forging of deep bonds,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to celebrating this significant milestone with our friends across the Pacific Ocean, and to building stronger relationships city to city at a time when the relationships between nations sometimes struggle. It&rsquo;s during these times that cities come together and lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""I am both honored and humbled to be traveling to Sapporo to celebrate&nbsp;the 60th Anniversary of this friendship with Mayor Wheeler and our 46 member delegation,&rdquo; said Michael Bacon, President of the Portland-Sapporo Sister City Association.&nbsp;&ldquo;Connecting the people of Sapporo and Portland through economic, cultural and educational exchanges continues to fulfill our mission of building a more peaceful and sustainable world.""</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler is also confirmed to visit Tokyo and the Kansai region to strengthen economic partnerships in regions that Prosper Portland, the City&rsquo;s economic development agency, has identified as strategic markets for developing trade opportunities. <strong><em>Japan is Oregon&rsquo;s 5th-largest export market with $1.8 billion U.S. dollars of goods and services from Oregon sold there in 2017</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em>Japan invests significantly in Oregon and our region compared to other top trading countries contributing to foreign direct investment here , making our relationship with them compelling and vital,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;Japanese investor companies are crucial to our economy, employing almost 7,000 Oregonians, many of whom work in the City of Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Japanese businesses invest and hire people in the region and the trade grows, the bond between the City of Portland, the State of Oregon and Japan grows stronger,&rdquo; said Masa Yamaguchi, an attorney at Lane Powell law firm who regularly works with in-bound Japanese businesses that are making direct investments in the Pacific Northwest region. &ldquo;Japanese people feel welcomed and comfortable here. The mutually beneficial relationships promote further growth and prosperity for the people on both sides of the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this trip, the Portland delegation will be learning about:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Advancing Sustainability and Innovation</li>
<li>Emergency management and safety around Seismic Resiliency</li>
<li>Promoting Equity, Inclusion &amp; Diversity&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Developing new economic partnerships&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partners joining the Mayor&rsquo;s delegation include the Portland-Sapporo Sister City Association, Prosper Portland, Travel Portland, Portland Japanese Garden, the Royal Rosarians, Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center, Portland State University and a contingent of citizens. Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s mission in Japan begins Wednesday, Oct. 23, and ends Thursday, Oct. 31.</p>

<p class=""xxmsonormal content-center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Portland&rsquo;s Office for Community Technology Denies Request for Zenith&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Expansion</span></strong></p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong>On Friday, Oct. 18, 2019, Portland&rsquo;s Office for Community Technology (OCT) denied Zenith Energy Terminal Holdings LLC&rsquo;s (Zenith&rsquo;s) request to install three additional pipes under NW Front Avenue.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;The OCT&rsquo;s decision is based on the <a href=""/citycode/article/557499"">City of Portland&rsquo;s 2015 Resolution No. 37168</a> to oppose the expansion of infrastructure for transporting or storing fossil fuels in or through Portland or adjacent waterways.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;In its letter to Zenith (see attachment), the OCT notes it does not have the capacity or expertise to adequately monitor and inspect Zenith&rsquo;s facility to ensure that the three new pipes are not transporting fossil fuels. The OCT also notes that Zenith is failing to meet its existing contractual commitments, noting a delayed payment of fees, and delayed reports required by the current agreement between Zenith and the OCT.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I support the OCT&rsquo;s decision,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;I am deeply dedicated to protecting our environment. Portland&rsquo;s commitment to be a climate leader nationally and globally requires a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner, renewable fuels and electrification of our transportation sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;With Mayor Ted Wheeler as its Commissioner-in-charge, the OCT&rsquo;s mission is to champion public policy and technology investments for communications and utility infrastructure, to keep our local communities economically and culturally healthy. Mayor Wheeler recently added $50,000 to his proposed Fall Budget Adjustment, to help fund a study that will identify the costs and risks associated with fossil fuel infrastructure in Portland. The allocation received unanimous support from City Council.</p>

<p class=""xxxmsonormal content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The City of Portland&rsquo;s Office of Government Relations is welcoming invited tribal officials from around the Northwest to build partnerships, strengthen collaborations and enhance diplomacy between the City of Portland and tribal nations in the region.

<p class=""xxmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Our newly established Tribal Relations Program is doing an exemplary job of connecting the City of Portland with our tribal government partners,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;This Summit continues our commitment to nurturing and deepening that connection, so we can listen and learn from tribal leaders about how we can more effectively work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;The City of Portland committed to honoring and respecting tribal treaty rights, federal-tribal trust responsibilities and traditional native spiritual beliefs in 2012, when City Council unanimously passed a resolution that directs the City to develop policies and procedures that support and affirm its commitment to consultation with tribal government partners. Commissioner Amanda Fritz co-authored the resolution.</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal content-center"">&nbsp;&ldquo;The resolution we passed in 2012 declared the City&rsquo;s commitment to formalize government-to-government relationships with tribal partners and laid the groundwork for our Tribal Relations Program,&rdquo; Commissioner Fritz said. &ldquo;I am proud that seven years later, we are staying true to that legislation and taking the work to the next level.

<p class=""content-center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Portlanders show their support for deconstructing &ndash; rather than demolishing &ndash; older buildings</span></strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>City Council hears testimony overwhelmingly in favor of requiring &ldquo;younger&rdquo; buildings to be subject to deconstruction ordinance</em><strong></strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">In 2016, Portland became the first city in North America to require deconstruction for its oldest and most historic houses when proposed for removal.&nbsp;<a href=""/bps/68520"">Portland&rsquo;s deconstruction ordinance</a> prioritizes material salvage and reuse over landfill, provides economic opportunity and workforce development, and facilitates the safe removal of hazardous materials.</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>New ordinance increases number of deconstructed houses</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">Today, Portland City Council heard a Bureau of Planning and Sustainability proposal to expand the current deconstruction ordinance from houses built before 1917 to houses built before 1941. <em>This proposed year-built threshold would increase the number of annually deconstructed houses from one third to two thirds of all house demolitions.</em></p>
<p class=""content-center"">Mayor Ted Wheeler introduced the proposal and highlighted how Portland is disrupting the business-as-usual approach to removing houses by mechanical demolition.</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&ldquo;We believe in a circular economy, where we move away from the linear model of using something once, throwing it out, and having it go to the landfill, and instead finding ways to creatively reuse materials,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler.</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Testimony focuses on benefits of proposed ordinance</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">Commissioners heard testimony on the benefits of expanding the ordinance from deconstruction companies, salvage retailers, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, United Neighbors for Reform (UNR) and Restore Oregon. Commissioner Amanda Fritz thanked UNR and other neighborhood associations for their efforts and support for this policy and noted that, &ldquo;The [ordinance is now the] standard for the nation. And instead of two deconstruction companies, there are 12 companies doing this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">Dave Bennink from the Building Deconstruction Institute talked about his role in training contractors and workforce development. He noted that other cities are looking to Portland for guidance on deconstruction as well as the exponential benefits from other cities replicating Portland&rsquo;s deconstruction model.</p>
<p class=""content-center""><a href=""/video/player/?tab=live"">Watch the hearing</a></p>
<p class=""content-center"">Since the deconstruction ordinance went into effect three years ago, more than 200 houses have been deconstructed. From those projects, over 2.4 million pounds of material was salvaged for reuse. That salvaged material &ndash; as well as avoided disposal and production impacts &ndash; translate to significant carbon benefits when compared to mechanical demolition.</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">Council overwhelmingly supported the expansion and will vote on the proposal next week.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Mayor Ted Wheeler appoints final four recommended members to the inaugural Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund Committee</span></strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Now the nine-member PCEF Committee can begin reviewing proposals, selecting grant recipients and distributing the first $7 million of clean energy funds</em></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class=""content-center"">One day after the anniversary of Portland voters passing the Portland Clean Energy Initiative (Nov. 6, 2018), Mayor Ted Wheeler appointed the final four members of the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund (PCEF) Committee at a City Council meeting at Portland Community College&rsquo;s SE campus. The final four committee appointees were recommended by the initial five committee members who were nominated&mdash;one each&mdash;by the five City Council members.</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&ldquo;A year ago, community members and organizations took a stand for a green future by passing the Portland Clean Energy Initiative, a nationally acclaimed model for climate action,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to announce the final appointments to the talented inaugural committee. It signals progress towards implementing a vision where all Portlanders, especially working families, have access to a green future with clean energy, living wage jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">The PCEF grants will create green jobs in the clean energy sector, fund improvements to homes through renewable energy and energy efficiency investments and support local businesses. It will also fund workforce training programs to create a pipeline to family wage jobs for under-served Portlanders.</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">As stated in the voter-approved ballot initiative, the nine-person committee is charged with reviewing proposals, selecting grant recipients, and recommending to City Council changes to the law to better achieve the goals of the fund.</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&ldquo;We are thrilled to welcome the final members to the PCEF Committee,&rdquo; said PCEF Program Manager, Sam Baraso. &ldquo;They are critical to delivering projects that matter to the community. And with the committee in place, we can begin building a program that is consistent with the vision of the voters. Our goal is to get the first $7 million in grants out the door late by Summer 2020.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">&ldquo;It is so rewarding to celebrate this milestone exactly one year after our measure won 65% of the vote in the 2018 election,&rdquo; said Jenny Lee, Advocacy Director at the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO) and a leader in the PCEF Coalition. &ldquo;We applaud and thank these extraordinary appointees as they move forward into the work of ensuring that Portland&rsquo;s communities on the frontlines of climate change receive long-overdue investments in job training, home improvements, and so much more. PCEF&rsquo;s community benefits will build resilience for people of color and low-income Portlanders while helping meet our city&rsquo;s climate action goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><strong>About the appointees</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center"">The PCEF ballot measure passed by Portland voters in 2018 required the initial five PCEF Committee members (appointed by City Council on Sept. 25, 2019) to recommend a slate of four final members for approval. They are:</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>PORTLAND CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO SUPPORT CHANGES TO TOURIST TAX STRUCTURE, CREATING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE OREGONIANS</strong></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Intergovernmental agreement still faces final approval by the Multnomah County Commission</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland City Council voted 3-0 today to support changes to the region&rsquo;s tourist tax structure, allowing the region&rsquo;s visitors fund to support housing for vulnerable Oregonians. The Metro Council voted unanimously last week to support the changes. The changes now face final approval by the Multnomah County Commission, which is scheduled to vote next week.</p>
<p>The visitors fund, mostly supported through a 13.3% room tax and a 17% rental car tax, has historically funded renovations and expansions at facilities like Portland&rsquo;5 Centers for the Arts, the Oregon Convention Center and redevelopment of Portland-area stadiums such as what is now Providence Park. The visitors fund also supports campaigns promoting Portland as a visitor destination, and operations at tourist venues like the Oregon Convention Center.</p>
<p>Tourist tax revenue has more than doubled this decade, creating opportunities to use tourist-generated resources to support wrap-around services for people living in new affordable housing being built through City of Portland and Metro housing bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made it clear that we must not only continue, but also intensify our efforts to address the homelessness crisis we&rsquo;re facing with a great sense of urgency. The allocation of new resources raised from tourism in our region will help us do just that,&rdquo; said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;This additional revenue stream will strengthen our ability to ensure that everyone has access to an affordable, safe place they deserve and can call home, and to the services they need to stay in their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the agreement, $2.5 million a year will be devoted to livability and safety and supportive services for people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of experiencing homelessness. That number will grow with over time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the solution to our housing crisis is to build more housing,&rdquo; said Metro Council President Lynn Peterson. &ldquo;We also know that some people need wrap-around services to help them stay in housing and break the cycles of homelessness and housing insecurity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""People living outside are getting older and struggling with disabilities and chronic health conditions. They don't have the luxury of waiting and neither should we. We know the federal government isn't going to swoop in and give us the funding we need,'' said Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury. &ldquo;So we have to think creatively and identify new revenues across the region, just like this one.""</p>
<p>The new agreement will also fund renovations to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum and Portland&rsquo;5 Centers for the Arts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tourists spent $5.3 billion in greater Portland in 2018,&rdquo; said Scott Cruickshank, general manager of Metro&rsquo;s Visitor Venues. &ldquo;Tourism is a huge part of our economy, and we need to make sure we continue to draw visitors from around the world to our great city.&rdquo;</p>
