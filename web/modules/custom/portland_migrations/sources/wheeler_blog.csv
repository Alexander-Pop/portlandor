<p class=""content-left"">The young women were very knowledgeable and passionate about the issues we face in our society. Their perception of the world was also refreshing and positive. They will be the future leaders of our City, and I cannot wait to see what&rsquo;s in store for them. Sky&rsquo;s the limit!</p>

<p>Although our nation celebrates July 4th as Independence Day, not everyone was able to partake in the freedom laid out in the Declaration of Independence. Even after the emancipation Proclamation slaves were kept by some in defiance. On June 19, 1865, Major Gordon Granger read General Order Number 3 in Galveston, Texas containing the words ""all slaves are free."" Juneteenth Dependence Day commemorates that important day in our history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Portland, we have a forty-five year tradition of celebrating Juneteenth because of the incredible work by community leaders like, Clara Peoples! Through her work and advocacy our community can carry on her legacy of recognizing the importance of inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Clean Start is more than just a trash removal program.

<p>The Clean Start program assesses barriers to employment and helps people move on to permanent full-time employment.&nbsp;Most of the trainees receive housing in one of Central City Concern's housing buildings during their employment.&nbsp;Each year, since 2015, about 50 trainees go through the program. In 2019, it is expected that the program will expand to 70 trainees.</p>

In previous years, we primarily encountered the introduction of bills intending&nbsp;to restrict abortion rights, such as most recently Measure 106 that was referred to the ballot in November of 2018, but those measures, thankfully, failed. In 2019, we are again witnessing measures restricting abortion rights in multiple states. We must fight against these restrictions to the right of safe and legal choice. I stand with my fellow City Council members in their concern over the current threats against abortion rights&mdash;which affect all members of our community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the devastation that comes when abortions are not legal, safe, and accessible,&rdquo; said Commissioner Hardesty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling on us as a city hold the line here and ask other progressive cities to join us in defending reproductive rights throughout the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Portlanders have every right to be concerned about the domestic and international shipment of crude and tar sands oil,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;I am proud to serve as Mayor of a city that has a long history of environmentalism. I remain opposed to any expansion or activity that would endanger the health and safety of communities in this city - and pose a serious threat to our natural environment. I look forward to engaging in meaningful discussion with Portlanders about steps we can take together to ensure this goal is met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City&rsquo;s ability to regulate oil trains and Zenith&rsquo;s activities is limited, but we should leave no stone unturned in finding ways to protect Portlanders. From extraction, to transport, to refinement, tar sands oil is the dirtiest and most dangerous form of fossil fuel. We don&rsquo;t need it and we don&rsquo;t want it in Portland or anywhere on our planet&rdquo; said Commissioner Chloe Eudaly.</p>
<p>This is a time for the public to express their concerns. It&rsquo;s also a time for the City to share what actions have been taken so far, where we stand, and discuss next steps.</p>
<p>The Zenith Community Forum is scheduled for <strong>Monday, July 15<sup>th</sup>, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM at the University of Portland&rsquo;s Buckley Auditorium.The event is open to the public and media.</strong></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/737222

<p>The three-day event--benefitting Meals on Wheels People and the Parkrose Community&mdash;was held at Rossi Farms in northeast Portland, where their goal is to connect people back to their roots, and where their food comes from. When we enjoy Farm-to-Table dining, we&rsquo;re not just supporting restaurants.

<p>Eating local is paramount to my lifestyle&mdash;not only because it supports those who contribute and our local economies&mdash;but also because it is environmentally responsible, all concepts that I value. By sourcing local ingredients, vendors reduce the number of miles ingredients travel, so less fuel is consumed and fewer emissions are released.</p>
<p>Portland is special because so many restaurants have adopted the Farm To Table approach, partnering with local farmers to provide the freshest ingredients. Portland's robust reputation as one of the most sustainable cities is bolstered because Portlanders value the environment, our community and our healthy, fresh and local menu options.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/737332

<p>Our office is working tirelessly to create efficient and lasting solutions to homelessness. The growing gap between housing costs and incomes in our region is increasing the number of those who experience housing insecurity and homelessness in Portland, which has led a rise in visible camping. That&rsquo;s why the we&rsquo;re partnering with Multnomah County to implement a new Navigation Team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Navigation Team is a vital piece of solving the housing crisis in our city. It focuses on taking a services-first approach to high-impact campsites, connecting campers to shelters, services, housing and health supports before a camp is posted for cleaning and removal. A new Navigation Center at the west end of the Broadway Bridge&mdash;offering 120 shelter beds for temporary housing&mdash;will facilitate the Navigation Team&rsquo;s work when it is completed. Along with offering housing opportunities and services to people who are experiencing homelessness, this compassionate, diligent team also addresses the impact of unsanctioned camping. The workers with the Navigation Team tirelessly connect with campers on a near-daily basis. Much like this crisis cannot be solved overnight, the Navigation Team is often in touch with people experiencing homelessness for a few weeks to make sure they are getting the support they need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the team has accomplished the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>109 individuals engaged total</li>
<li>18 people screened and assessed for supportive housing</li>
<li>5 couples and 9 singles (19 total) helped into shelter</li>
<li>36 people helped to receive IDs</li>
<li>20 people helped to receive birth certificates</li>
<li>25 signed up for medical insurance under the Oregon Health Plan</li>
<li>2 provided with eyeglasses</li>
<li>3 helped into substance abuse treatment</li>
<li>14 given housing referrals</li>

Located in the heart of the city&rsquo;s Old Town area, it&rsquo;s one of the most popular spots to visit. Whether you&rsquo;re chasing entertainment, looking for a great craft cocktail or dancing, you can find it there.</p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday nights, approximately 10,000 people come to the Entertainment District, so we&rsquo;ve made it a priority to ensure the safety of all those in the area. Though crime has been greatly reduced since the City of Portland began focused efforts to put safety measures in place, there have still been crimes in the district that negatively impact public safety. This is why my office, Portland Police and Entertainment District business owners thought it would be important to create the Bar Summit.</p>
<p>For several weeks now, the Bar Summit has come together and increased communication and collaboration among businesses, area residents and the City to see how we can further create a safer nightlife experience. Through this collaboration, the business community has shared concerns and focused on ways to increase safety for the entertainment area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group will soon come to the city council to report on progress and the specific steps being taken by community partners. The goal is to foster a safe environment, while the community enjoys the best of Portland's nightlife.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/737994

<p class=""content-center""><em>On November 27, 2018, Mayor Ted Wheeler speaks at the opening of Hazel Heights, an affordable housing community in SE Portland</em></p>
<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s racist governing history created disparities that still exist today. In the past, in North and Northeast Portland, African Americans were segregated, and the neighborhoods were redlined or denied access to housing loans. Large public investments such as the construction of the I-5 freeway and Legacy Emanuel Hospital, including demolition of housing and commercial buildings, caused displacement and physically split predominately African American communities. The City of Portland was eliminating the housing stock in neighborhoods that people of color could buy in, while at the same time limiting where people of color could live. This caused mass involuntary displacement and the ultimate decimation of historically black neighborhoods, particularly in North and Northeast Portland.</p>
<p>This displacement is also a result of gentrification. In the Portland Plan, it states, &ldquo;<em>Gentrification often means that the change has resulted in involuntary displacement of residents and businesses. It can occur as the result of rising property values, redevelopment or land clearance. Most often, lower income populations, renters and the businesses that serve them are displaced and/or separated from community and social support systems&rdquo;<strong><sup>(<a href=""/portlandplan/56527"">More information here</a>)</sup></strong>.</em> The harm of gentrification is tangible and measurable. It includes:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Loss of access to desirable locations;</li>
<li>Displacement of individuals and businesses to fewer desirable locations;</li>
<li>A loss of wealth when homeowners leave without realizing the increased property values</li>
<li>Loss of the ability for current residents to enjoy the<a href=""file:///C:/Users/avalderrama/Downloads/Adopted_PDXPLAN_Web.pdf ""> benefits of revitalization</a></li>

<p>In our city, more than half of people of color living in Portland are economically insecure. With housing prices rising over time, Portlanders are more likely to be priced out of their historical neighborhoods and away from their communities to find more affordable housing.</p>

<p>The Mayor proposed funding for an Anti-Displacement Action Plan to be developed, building off the anti-displacement policies in the Comprehensive Plan. As the steward of the Comp Plan, he&rsquo;s asked the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability to lead the planning process.

The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) has observed a significant decrease in crime in and around <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=186&amp;searchtext=holladay"">Holladay Park</a>. Statistics compiled by PPB&rsquo;s Strategic Services Division have shown that calls received regarding Holladay Park have decreased significantly. This indicates that the Holladay Park Safety Plan has achieved its goal, which was to decrease crime around that area.</p>
<p>The data shows that calls for service have seen a 50% decrease in assaults, an 18% decrease in disturbances and a 45% decrease in thefts from May 5 through July 22 of this year compared to the same period in 2018. Community partners have been an instrumental part of this process to achieve these results.

<p>As commissioner of PPB, I strongly believe it is important for community members to feel safe in&nbsp;public spaces so that we can all enjoy the benefits of Portland&rsquo;s parks. PPB has worked tirelessly to reduce incidents in this area, and I am proud of the Police Bureau for achieving its goals to increase community safety and improve relationships with the community. Some of the organizations who were instrumental in the creation of this plan include the Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church, SOLVE, Portland Parks and Recreation, Multnomah County District Attorney's Office, Rosewood Initiative, Portland OIC, Portland Public Schools, Transit Police Division, Bonneville Power Administration, Federal Protective Services, Portland Police Bureau, Providence Health Care, Connected, Church of Scientology, Portland 5 and Lloyd EcoDistrict.</p>

<p>September has been an exceptionally busy month for me and my team. We have been diligently working on how we can better our City by addressing some of the most pressing issues and finding meaningful solutions that will have a lasting impact.&nbsp;Earlier this month, my Deputy Chief of Staff, Jamal Fox had the opportunity to sit on a panel and talk candidly about his experiences navigating the workplace as a black man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was joined by Chief of Police Danielle Outlaw, Fire Chief Sara Boone, and former Human Resource Director Serilda Summers-McGee, each being the first black female Chief of Police, Fire Chief, and Human Resource Director respectively for the City.</p>
<p>The questions asked of them were powerful, and their answers even more so. This panel addressed issues that were uncomfortable but crucial to understanding their work and acknowledging the perseverance it has taken each of these individuals to obtain the level of success&nbsp;that they have in their respective careers, along with the high level of professionalism they exude.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" style=""font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-size: 13.2px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=743204"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""219.333333333"" /></p>
<p>One of my many priorities is creating a more diverse workplace where individuals feel welcomed, supported and included regardless of how they identify, or how they are identified as by the dominant culture.&nbsp;Having Jamal, Danielle, Sara, and Serilda in senior leadership roles in the City gives me hope.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong></strong><strong>Exciting, Unique, New and Effective Solutions</strong></h2>
<p>Another top priority that touches many of our lives, is how we think of humanity and our fellow humans. Homelessness is a societal crisis and I'm deeply committed to ensuring individuals experiencing homelessness are treated compassionately and respectfully. That is why my team and I are collaborating with my colleagues and community partners across all agencies to develop the Portland Street Response (PSR) program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The program is important for two primary reasons. First, it addresses the over-criminalization of houseless/homeless individuals and pairs their needs with the proper response and services. Secondly, the First Responder system is overwhelmed with calls that are not related to criminal activity. This new program will help relieve First Responder resources so they can address more serious call types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSR is unique because we reached out to the homeless to ask what they need in a First Responder, rather than determining the answer for them. After surveying the homeless and analyzing the response, the answers were not surprising. They expressed a need for first responders who are mental health professionals, social workers, nurses, EMTs, peer support, and conflict resolution specialists.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">I recognize the PSR&nbsp;is not a catch-all solution, however, it is a piece of the larger puzzle towards solving the seemingly intractable homelessness problem, and hence, a step in the right direction. The PSR program paired with other services has the potential to produce meaningful and measurable results while providing focused help to people through a compassionate and humane approach.</p>
<p class=""content-right""><img class=""content-left"" style=""float: left;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=743230"" alt="""" width=""301"" height=""225.75"" /></p>
<p class=""content-left"">Pairing services with others will make programs more effective which is crucial for addressing homelessness. This is about our values, that every person deserves a safe place to sleep and to call their own. As the Mayor of a city with unprecedented economic growth in our region, I am acutely aware that this growth also brings additional economic pressure on those who aren&rsquo;t experiencing the benefits of that growth.</p>
<h2><strong>Innovative Approach to the Shelter Service Model</strong></h2>
<p>The Laurelwood Center&rsquo;s opening in the Foster-Powell neighborhood represented a distinct change in the way shelters across Portland work.&nbsp; At this shelter, there are 120 beds, and people can bring their pets, their partners, their possessions, and they don&rsquo;t have to line up night after night with the hopes of maybe getting into shelter.&nbsp;<img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=743220"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""300"" /></p>
<p>possible through the work of the City of Portland, Multnomah County, and Transition Projects. The primary goal is combining the shelter component with the service component. The one-on-one services that are provided at Laurelwood help to ensure that people are provided with whatever they need to get into permanent housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">With the rise in houseless individuals on the rise since 2017, my office has been working tirelessly to help open more shelters with a service component, especially with winter fast-approaching. We are intentionally designing dignified spaces for people to get connected to services and get back into housing.</span></p>

<p><strong style=""; font-size: 1.3em;"">Bridging the Gap in Housing Funding</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Despite all we&rsquo;ve already accomplished, we&rsquo;re just getting started. Last month, I was excited to announce the city&rsquo;s nine new projects that have been selected for funding from Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond. We now have enough Bond-funded housing units completed or in progress across the city to me&mdash;and in some cases even exceed&mdash;all the goals set forth under Portland&rsquo;s Housing Bond, and there are still funds left over to do even more good work. We now have all the units either completed or in progress to hit our Bond goals &ndash; or surpass them, creating housing for more than 2,900 people with 658 units for families with two bedrooms or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-left""><img class=""content-left"" style=""float: left;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=743231"" alt=""Housing Bond"" width=""300"" height=""399.75"" />These investments have been specifically targeting our communities of color, to mitigate displacement, and to invest in our East Portland neighborhoods. For these accomplishments&mdash;a testimony to the compassion and caring of the good people of the City of Portland, the voters who made it all possible&mdash;I say <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">thank you</span>!</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Once again, this action we&rsquo;re taking reflects the values we as a city embrace every day. Every one of us, our families, our friends, our teachers, our students &ndash; all deserve healthy, safe and affordable places to live. You have my promise that we will continue finding and implementing solutions to homelessness. We&rsquo;re in this together and it will take a community effort to achieve our goals.</p>

<p class=""content-left"">We are at the forefront of that climate crisis, and I recognize the global climate emergency.

<p>I also spoke about the Portland Clean Energy Fund as an example of a community-led vision for a ""Green New Deal"", and a new way to approach climate action that ensures strategies to reduce carbon and deliver community benefits and address economic inequality.</p>

I am also committed to implementing substantive policies and programs to address the top causes of air pollution emissions in Portland before 2025.</p>
<p>Through the Summit sessions, the Portland team learned about actions other cities are taking to transition to renewable energy, ways to green their streets and make public transit more affordable and attractive, tackle air pollution, create zero-emission zones and close streets to cars, use green bonding tools to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency, move towards more sustainable food choices and increase resilience, among many other topics.</p>

<p class=""content-justify"">Cupid Alexander, the Director of Strategic Initiatives with my office, recently visited the United Kingdom to learn best practices on environmental sustainability, jobs of the future, equity in society and good governance. While there, Cupid solidified relationships with other Mayors, governments, non-profits and businesses. With these stronger relationships, our office has enhanced opportunity to coordinate to improve transportation infrastructure, and increase environmental sustainability by reducing carbon emissions. These partnerships will spark conversations about the best way to live, work, travel and enjoy Portland. Identifying opportunities that exist within the Portland Metropolitan Area to partner with businesses will help our city expand its green infrastructure, create more sustainable jobs and reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<p class=""content-justify"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-justify"">Towards the end of October, I had the opportunity to fly to Sapporo, Japan, our sister city. Our Sister Cities program began shortly after World War II to build diplomatic, cultural and economic networks between our cities and respective nations. This year, Portland and Sapporo are celebrating 60 years of sister city partnership. That&rsquo;s 60 years of sharing economic prosperity, knowledge, earthquake resilience strategies and the forging of deep bonds. The rich history and traditions shared between Portland and Sapporo are the backbone of a successful international trade initiative.</p>
<p class=""content-justify"">Following my trip to Sapporo, I visited Tokyo and the Kansai region to strengthen economic partnerships that Prosper Portland, the City&rsquo;s economic development agency, has identified as strategic markets for developing trade opportunities. Japan is Oregon&rsquo;s 5th-largest export market with $1.8 billion U.S. dollars of goods and services from Oregon sold there in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; During this trip, our Portland delegation will be learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""content-justify"">Advancing Sustainability and Innovation</li>
<li class=""content-justify"">Emergency management and safety around Seismic Resiliency</li>
<li class=""content-justify"">Promoting Equity, Inclusion &amp; Diversity&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li class=""content-justify"">Developing new economic partnerships&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Hope for the Holidays: Winter Weather Preparedness</strong></h2>
<p class=""content-justify"">As Portland inches closer to winter, those living outside are the most vulnerable. That&rsquo;s why the City of Portland is partnering with Multnomah County to encourage our community to donate and volunteer to help those living outside prepare for cold weather.

The Mayor's Blog,747887,November In Review,1,,2019-11-25 23:22:16 UTC,2019-11-25 23:02:00 UTC,A,,"<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Mayor Hosts Forum on Community Safety and Livability in SE Portland Neighborhood</strong></h2>
<p>On November 5th, members of my staff and I led a panel of law enforcement experts and officials to address community safety and livability in the Lents Neighborhood. Representatives from Portland Police Bureau's Gun Violence Reduction Team (GVRT) and Detective Division, along with representatives from the City's One Point of Contact Program and the Police Bureau's East Precinct, were all in attendance. Over the summer, Lents experienced an increase in shootings and homicides. Lents is also impacted by homelessness as well. The goal of the town hall was to provide an update on progress made on crime in the Lent's neighborhood and talk about livability.</p>
<p>I heard members of the community express their frustration over the state of livability and safety in Lents. East Portland is today the heart and soul of the City of Portland. My goal as Mayor is to make the lives of all Portlanders better, and that includes explicitly those of you who live and work here. I am a strong advocate for the Portland Street Response program, for which my office set aside 500,000 dollars to invest in the pilot program. I know many of you want a robust public safety system in terms of jails and District Attorneys. Multnomah County funds some elements of public safety. We need to collaborate more effectively and lobby the county for much needed public safety dollars. As a city, we will work directly with you to address the crime, safety, and livability in Lents today and into the future.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>City of Portland Tribal Summit</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""content-center"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=747888"" alt="""" width=""370"" height=""190.304424779"" /></strong></p>
<p>On November 5th and 6th, the City of Portland hosted the 2nd annual Tribal Nation Summit. The Tribal Nation Summit continues the commitment to develop partnerships and deepening relationships with tribal nations in the region. The summit is an opportunity to listen and learn from one another as we move forward with a commitment to strengthen collaborations and enhance diplomacy.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the summit, over 200 City employees participated in a day-long Tribal Relations Training, hosted by the Portland State University's Institute for Tribal Government. The training provided foundational knowledge to better understand tribal governance and sovereignty, and to bring to light the impact of the City's work on supporting tribal people.</p>
<p>The Office of Government Relations coordinated a day of focused discussions with tribal elected leaders. The goal of these discussions was to bring City senior leadership to the table and create space for opportunities for collaboration. Topics included housing, public safety, natural &amp; cultural resource protection, climate action collaboration, inadvertent discovery planning, first foods, and economic development.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Introducing Our LGBTQ+ Intern: Matthew Palmer</strong></h2>
<p class=""content-center""><strong><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=747885"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""337.048334115"" /></strong></p>
<p>I want to highlight the work that our LGBTQIA+ Community Outreach Coordinator Intern, Matthew Palmer, is doing in our office. Matthew was hired in August, joining our team straight after leaving his Legislative Assistant position in the Oregon Legislature at the end of its session. Though only being here for a few short months, he has done a great job of establishing himself as a valuable resource for local LGBTQIA+ organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>His primary objective with this new position has been to be an effective mouthpiece for the community members that rely on him. Up until Matthew joined this team, there had not been a singular person in City Hall solely devoted to analyzing policy through an LGBTQIA+ lens. Matthew hopes that through him, local organizations and individuals can feel as though their voices are heard in the halls of power that had historically treated them as less-than. He knows how crucial it is that LGBTQIA+ have a seat at the table. It is Matthew's mission to make sure that their voices are amplified and empowered.</p>
<p>He started his first days in my office by updating the outdated LGBTQ+ Resources page on the city website to better and more accurately reflect the current resources available to the community. He has become a sitting member on the Alliance for Safer Communities group, an integral part of the Transgender Day of Visibility planning committee, and a leader of the LGBTQ+ &amp; Friends Affinity Group. He is focused on various policy initiatives aimed at empowering transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, a system for better tracking and recording the City's hiring and retention rates of LGBTQIA+ employees, and at developing more opportunities for LGBTQIA+ voices to be heard in different areas of local government. Matthew is a valued addition to our office, and I am thankful to have him.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Celebrating a Historic Moment - Louisa Flowers Grand Opening </strong></h2>
<p>There is a lot to be thankful for and celebrate, and this month we are celebrating the grand opening of Louisa Flowers. This new apartment community will provide 240 affordable housing units. This is a direct result of our belief as a city that everyone deserves to have a safe, secure affordable place that they can call home.</p>
<p>A housing crisis like we've experienced in Portland demands historical action, and that's what this project represents. The opening of Louisa Flowers is the largest affordable housing project to open in Portland in the last 50 years, and I am proud to be a part of this historic event.</p>
<p>All 240 units are affordable, and 20 will serve our lowest-income neighbors (households at or below 30% Median Family Income). To be able to provide all affordable units in a building of this scale is an impressive feat, and it's a true testament to Home Forward's deep commitment to the people of Portland, and to provide stable, affordable homes for our community.</p>
<p>This means that hundreds of Portlanders will soon be walking out of their front doors into a neighborhood that is rich with opportunity, commercial potential, and transit to take them to their jobs, their schools, appointments, or everyday errands. For some, the Louisa Flowers is where they will get their start, close to living-wage employment, and paying rent they can afford while they work and save toward their goals.</p>
<p>For others, this development will provide a safe, stable foundation for a new beginning.</p>
<p>Because all of us here know and understand that housing is about more than the physical building; it's about realizing a vision for the people who will live there. It's about recognizing the dreams, health, and prosperity they can achieve with a stable home in a thriving neighborhood, and the right support.</p>
<p>This project is yet another example of the strong partnership between the Portland Housing Bureau, Home Forward, and Multnomah County. It represents local government coming together in a crisis to respond with the will and resources to make a difference for the community. And it's a milestone in our ongoing collective effort to make this a more affordable and equitable city.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>In the Community Council Sessions </strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=747886"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""180"" /></strong></p>
<p>A priority of mine is to meet people where they are, in their communities, and in spaces where they can feel comfortable. That is why my team and I have prioritized holding occasional evening council sessions out in the community. For me, it is beneficial to hear the voices of community members that generally could not make the trip to City Hall during regular business hours.&nbsp; This last month, we held two separate sessions, one at Portland Community College and the other at Self Enhancement, Inc. If you missed the previous sessions, please watch for notices announcing when and where the next Community Council Sessions will be held.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/article/747887
