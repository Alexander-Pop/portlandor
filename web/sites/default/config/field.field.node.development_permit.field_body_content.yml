Types of reviews include planning and zoning, structural, and fire. Reviewers check to see that your proposal is in compliance with the specific code or regulation. If the proposal is in compliance, the reviewer will sign off and the proposal will move to the next review group. If the reviewer needs additional information or has identified corrections to the proposal, they will request this information from you in writing in the form of a <strong>checksheet</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Types of plan review groups\L</li>\r\n\t<li>Tracking your building permit application\L</li>\r\n\t<li>How to respond to a permit checksheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You may need to revise your plans in response to a checksheet created by a review group. After all checksheets have been completed by that group, the plan will pass to the new group for review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the last technical review is approved, your permit will be pre issued. You will be notified that your permit is ready, and of your final fee total. You may pick up your permit from the Development Services Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Inspections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you pick up your permit, you will receive an orange (residential) or yellow (commercial) inspection card listing all of the inspections you will need during construction. When all of your inspections are approved, you will receive a final inspection and your project is complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To schedule an inspection, you call our integration voice recognition system (IVR):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"btn powr-btn-link\" href=\"tel:+1503-823-7000\">503-823-7000</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IVR system will schedule the first available inspection date for you. To reschedule or cancel an inspection, you must call in your request no later than 6 a.m. on the scheduled inspection date.</p>\r\n"
