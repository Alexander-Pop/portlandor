# Local services, default version
#
# This is the default version of the local.services file, which replicates produciton settings.
# The local.services.yml file is required to run the site locally, but it is no longer managed 
# in source control. To run the site locally, make a copy of this file and rename it
# local.services.yml. To run the site locally in development mode (caching off, debug on, etc.),
# make a copy of local.services.dev.yml and rename it local.servies.yml.
