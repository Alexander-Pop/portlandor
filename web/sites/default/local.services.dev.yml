# Local services, development version
#
# This is the development version of the local.services file, enables development settings:
# caching off, debug on, etc. The local.services.yml file is required to run the site locally, 
# but it is no longer managed in source control. To run the site locally in development mode, 
# make a copy of this file and rename it # local.services.yml. To run the site locally in 
# production mode (caching on, debug off, etc.), make a copy of local.services.default.yml and
# rename it local.servies.yml.
